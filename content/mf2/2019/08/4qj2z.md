As https://charity.wtf puts it, we should be comfortable with deploying no matter what day or time of the week, because our tooling and processes should give us confidence. It's an antipattern and a sign that something is wrong if we don't want to do it.\n\nBut at the same time, you don't want to be staying up late on a Friday because someone pushed something, and then have it potentially ruin your weekend.\n\nIt's definitely a hard line to walk, but as this article says, we should opt for something a bit more risky, to give us more confidence"
