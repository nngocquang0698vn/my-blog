Taking time to create something new instead of just consuming others' content, especially as you're all going to have some really interesting things to share.\n\nHowever, we also need to remember that it's OK to have downtime, and consuming others' content is ok! (And yes, this is a little ironic coming from me, a person who is seemingly always productive and pushing out new content)!",
