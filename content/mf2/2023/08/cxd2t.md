Several Open Source projects have subsets of different licenses in use across the codebase and as long as they're explicit and compatible it's all good.\n\nEverything in my site [defaults to AGPL-3.0](https://gitlab.com/tanna.dev/jvt.me/-/blob/main/LICENSE.md) but then I've got post-specific overrides to make them Creative Commons / Apache-2.0 / otherwise as appropriate"
