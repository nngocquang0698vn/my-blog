There is a blue notebook, embossed with the Elastic logo, a black polo shirt, a set of stickers with the Elastic values that are super cute and really nicely stylised, a bright blue Elastic, a bright pink Elastic tshirt, a black hoodie, a pair of socks, and a slightly stripy water bottle. All the clothes are incredibly soft, and very high quality. There is also (not pictured) a darker blue \"helper node\" tshirt for volunteering in",
