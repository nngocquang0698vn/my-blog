We then spent a couple of days talking about it - and boom, Craig is now running his own Homebrew Website Club on 18th July (https://getdoingthings.com/homebrew-website-club-barnsley-1/).\n\nLast night Craig posted this great post about joining the community and with some great explanations for newbies. Welcome, Craig!",
