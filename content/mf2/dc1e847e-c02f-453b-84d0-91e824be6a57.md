So for something much more exciting, Neal took us through taking an existing application using a PHP framework, and chucked it onto Lambda with Bref, in an *incredibly easy fashion*. I was incredibly bowled over how easy it was. All we needed to do was:\n\n- refer static assets to an S3 bucket/Content Distribution Network, not on the same host as the PHP process\n- externalise session stores, as you will most likely hit a different instance of your function\n- externalise your file store, i.e. an S3 bucket, as you can't store files long-term in a function's container, which can be done with pre-signed URLs\n\nAnd now we had a pretty standard PHP app, with an admin backend, working in AWS Lambda. Awesome stuff.\n\nAs Neal mentioned, now we're delegating some of these pieces of work to the cloud provider, we can remove a load of code from our application - win-win!\n\nNeal mentioned there are some performance impacts of running Lambdas in an AWS VPC, and how they can be ~10x increase in response times (citing https://medium.freecodecamp.org/lambda-vpc-cold-starts-a-latency-killer-5408323278dd)\n\nBut Lambda can still make huge differences to your underlying bills - one user of Bref cited that for quite large workloads, they were saving ~25% against EC2.\n\nNeal also mentioned that there has been some work towards getting WordPress running on Lambda, although it's still very much a work in progress.\n\nAlthough I'm not a PHP dev, it was a great talk, and I can see lots of great things that I can apply to my own projects.",
