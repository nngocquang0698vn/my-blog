      "value" : "I'm quite heavily into the [IndieWeb movement](https://indieweb.org/why), in which we've designed a new standard [Microsub](https://indieweb.org/Microsub) which allows for a slightly better API than \"regular\" RSS/Atom readers, as it allows for you to use different feed formats on the backend. It also splits between the client and the server quite nicely, so I can use [Indigenous for Android](https://indigenous.realize.be/) when on the move, and [Monocle](https://monocle.p3k.io/) when I'm on the desktop. The best thing about the standard, aside from allowing extensible feed parsing, is that I can use different clients to read it, instead of relying on a single provider - which I believe we've seen with _some_ of the RSS/Atom readers around currently.\r\n\r\nThe server I use is [Aperture](https://aperture.p3k.io/), built and run by @aaronparecki.com, and I subscribe to a mix of RSS/Atom, JSON Feed and [Microformats2](https://microformats.io) feeds"
