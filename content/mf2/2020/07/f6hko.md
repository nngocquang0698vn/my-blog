Templating / documentation is not the best, especially if you're not used to Go's templating. I moved from Jekyll last year https://www.jvt.me/posts/2019/01/04/goodbye-jekyll-hello-hugo/ and have found it a much better experience. It's super quick to build (even for my large multi-purpose site) and has a tonne of stuff built-in to it that makes it fairly batteries included"
