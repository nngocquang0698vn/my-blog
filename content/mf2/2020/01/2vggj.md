Long posts I do still refine over time, but generally want them done at most a few days after it's finished being written.\n\nIf it's a Blogumentation post (https://www.jvt.me/posts/2017/06/25/blogumentation/ ) then I'll actively not refine it too much as a long post as the point is that it's for me in the future so if its not as readable I'll just edit it then"
