      "value" : "\"likely weren't\" - this is the whole point! \"likely\" implies that there were people who were affected, having the risk of assault, rape, or murder. It's very unlikely that we'll know for sure, but making a feature opt-in to literally protect people isn't the end of the world. \"negative default settings\" was the state of play before the change. They didn't give people a choice, and didn't provide sufficient support to users to understand this. So by making the change, we're now in \"positive default settings\""
