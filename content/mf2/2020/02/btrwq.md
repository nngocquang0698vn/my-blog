Speaking about your health allows everyone to be a bit more open about everything - one reason I blogged about my <a href=\"https://www.jvt.me/posts/2018/02/14/2017-in-review/<a href=\"/tags/ruptured/\">#ruptured</a>-appendix\">ruptured appendix</a> was that it would show others what I'd gone through, what they could learn from it, and understand just how sucky it was for me.\n\nAdditionally, speaking about mental health is incredibly important, as most folks suffer from it, just don't talk about it, and awareness of it can help folks get diagnosis / help if they're not aware of it."
