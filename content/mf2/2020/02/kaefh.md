So I've just added the ability to mark up my interactions with some context of what the post was so it's eaiser to see without navigating there. \r\n\r\nThis is using the awesome https://granary.io/ and will hopefully make reading Twitter interactions through my site much nicer!\r\n\r\nYou can see https://www.jvt.me/mf2/2020/02/ihnc5/ for an example of what it'll look like (including photos!), and https://indieweb.org/reply-context for more info from around the <a href=\"/tags/indieweb/\">#indieweb</a>\r\n"
