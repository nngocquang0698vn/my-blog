This is super exciting, and I'm hoping to possibly get some extra swag for it.</p>\n\n<p>I hope you're able to come along and contribute back to some of the projects we're all using for our websites, or maybe find something new to play with for your site.</p>\n\n<p>I'll also be looking to create a blog post about what Hacktoberfest is and why you should get involved - keep an eye out!</p>"
