I thoroughly recommend https://theadhocracy.co.uk/wrote/one-year-in-the-indieweb as a note of whether you want to be indieweb or IndieWeb because there's a very different set of goals folks want, and I know a number of people who've come into the community, tried to tick off all the things in the list, got bored/annoyed and left. Do you want to own more data? Just want to have a website? Want to have a decentralised identity provider like https://indieauth.spec.indieweb.org?"
