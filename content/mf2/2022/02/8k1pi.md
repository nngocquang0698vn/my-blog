It's been so convenient and made the weekly shop a fun 10 minute experience of \"ooh that looks good\".\n\nThere's currently a great discount so you - and us - can get a load of money off and see if it's worth it, using my referral code [`JAMIE21201650`](https://cook.gousto.co.uk/raf?promo_code=JAMIE21201650&utm_source=androidapp) ."
