I've been using https://fed.brid.gy to allow folks to follow my site at @www.jvt.me@www.jvt.me and I send webmentions to Bridgy to auto-syndicate my posts to my followers' servers. Means I don't need an RSS->Mastodon bot and outsources all the hard work to the service built by the wonderful @snarfed.org which may be of interest, but could also be a little too much work if you'd prefer to avoid doing it with adding a bot"
