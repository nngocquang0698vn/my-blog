But either way it's still a tonne of effort so good on you going through it, and making progress on looking after yourself \n\nAre there any hobbies / things you can do as a way to relax and focus on? I've found jigsaws/playing with Lego has helped a fair bit, whereas I would usually just use gaming as complete escapism"
