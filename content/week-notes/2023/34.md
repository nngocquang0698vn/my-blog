- Done some good pieces on oapi-codegen this week - ahead of looking to do a release next week - including:
  - Getting most of the way through the [migration to libopenapi](https://github.com/deepmap/oapi-codegen/pull/1211), which wasn't nearly as complex as needed
  - Having some chats with Marcin about long-term state of the project and some of the things we've got planned
- Passed my driving theory test (second attempt, after a couple of weeks ago) üëè
  - [_Here I Am Alive_](https://open.spotify.com/track/7hfmZXu7REZOMVYTqfhFaI) blasting on the way home was perfect
  - Got a very nice welcome back from Cookie
- Been reading my Bridgy Fed feed a lot more, although realising I need to get my full following list set up
- Cookie may not have enjoyed me pretending to be a dog and playing with her biccie ball
- Had a pretty bad night's sleep on Thursday with a house alarm going off nearby, and a power cut
- Had a very nom bakewell tart from Naughty But Nice
- Accidentally forgot to feed Cookie on Thursday morning ü´£ She was super chill despite that, but luckily remembered around 1100 so it could settle before her walk with Denise
- Had a nice weekend at my parents'
  - Had some pretty awful rain as we left the house - on our way to Rushcliffe - as well as just after our walk and before we set off
  - Got to meet lil' Cleo ü•∞ She's so cute, floppy and puppy-y, and she got in between my legs just like Cookie ü•∫
  - Was very nice to be able to get some time with her, with Mum and Dad taking Cookie and having a very chill time with her
- Luckily Gousto survived sitting on the doorstep for a few hours this afternoon, and wasn't stolen
- Got some very exciting news about some public speaking coming up, keep your eyes peeled üëÄ
- After Morph was meowing at the window one day, I decided to prove his cat flap does work by giving him some biscuits and he sped through his cat flap üòÖ
- Alexa for some reason has "300%" on our shopping list
- Still not seeing Starling notifications on our joint account, of which we've realised that it looks like it's only when we're using Google Pay
