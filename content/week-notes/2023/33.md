My first week at Elastic, which ended up only being a four day week as it was a [Shut It Down Day](https://www.jvt.me/mf2/2023/08/d3732/)

- My first week at Elastic
  - Largely spent getting my laptop set up
    - Classically on Arch Linux so spent a bit of time getting it installed on my ThinkPad P1 Gen 5
    - Using my usual dotfiles + setup
    - Spent some time writing an alternative to MeetingBar for my work laptop - unfortunately i3-agenda isn't quite what I wanted - and thought it'd be a straightforward-enough thing to write my own that targets my own specific use case. Didn't get around to finishing it and putting it in a place that I can share it (yet) but it will be coming soon
  - Also managed to get all my mandatory training done, so now I can start getting set up on my team's projects
  - Nice to be back on Linux ... although I had a few bits of fun with audio not working 😅 Think it's all solved now, but a classic problem to have
  - Also happened to be the every-two-weeks Go lightning talks, which didn't have a talk planned, so I had some time to chat to some other folks in the Go community
- Had a great first Shut It Down Day with Elastic - which was very well timed for my first week, even though I didn't even know it was planned this week
  - Did some maintenance for oapi-codegen and looking at trying to [trim down the dependency tree for `pkg/runtime`](https://github.com/deepmap/oapi-codegen/pull/1197), but after chatting with folks on the Gopher Slack, decided that this specific route isn't the best idea
  - Had a very nice massage
- Had the last of the (very good Costco) Korean Fried Chicken in the air fryer for lunch one day 😋
- A butterfly got caught in the conservatory - but unlike a fly or bee - just flew straight out as soon as the door was opened for it 👏
- Thanks to Fluffy for reporting issues with duplicated content in RSS that no longer needs to be there (originally for Bridgy's Twitter publishing)
- Cookie picked up something on a walk and I had to get it out of her mouth - twice 😅
- Managed to stroke the Morph-lookalike-kitty on the road behind ours before Cookie saw
- Was really nice to go out for dinner on Friday evening at Rakki Rakkas with Carol 🥰
  - The first time we've eaten in since the renovations, it's really nice!
  - Had a strawberry daquiri and iskender 😋😋😋
- Yesterday Morph was chirping at some birds in the garden and Cookie kept getting confused thinking they were inside (and not, in fact, Morph) and then barked at the "birds" and scared them out of the garden 😹
- Morph got some of his biscuits on the conservatory side, and he was slobbering over them so much, when he then tried to jump up he slipped a little bit with how wet the side was 😹
- Cookie did _not_ get spayed because she's still got some signs from her phantom pregnancy, which was super frustrating, and now we have ~6 weeks to wait until we can get her done 😾
- Got a great Asda pizza 😋 and they've got a meat feast (not meetup-style meaty) that was good

Watched:
