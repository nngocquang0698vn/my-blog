My penultimate week at Deliveroo, with lots of handover and trying to get through the things I'd like to do before I'm offski

- Got [my first code contribution raised to Go](https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/go/+/508401)
- The gardeners have made a huge difference to the front and driveway, and it's amazing how nice the front looks now!
- Cookie been a bit of a gremlin the last few days
- Was nice to have Sarah to stay this weekend, and to see Carol and Juno this afternoon for a bit
- Got the last talk written up for my LeadDev blog post, now just need to go through and edit it, hopefully tomorrow will be the day it's live ðŸ¤ž
  - Managed to smash the rest of it done this afternoon with headphones on
- Had some fun dealing with CloudFlare's SQL protection for `GROUP BY` (but not `group by`) queries
- My new monitor arrived, which is subtly different in terms of the colours, which is a bit offputting and the buttons are slightly different layout, but it's still very nice
  - And in good "I'm 100% an adult" material, it turns out my old monitor _does_ still work, it's just that the power cable no longer works ðŸ˜… I wonder why Windows hasn't been able to cope with the monitor for many, many months, when Linux has been working up until now.
- Been nerd sniped a little bit around [Git merging the hard way](https://www.jvt.me/posts/2023/07/13/github-merge-api-manual/) at work, which may not be working (but may be) ðŸ˜…
- Had [a bit of an awkward bug with IndiePass](https://github.com/IndiePass/indiepass-android/issues/440), but turns out it seems to be a known issue with the latest Firefox Nightly version
- After [_The Answer is Nowhere_](https://open.spotify.com/track/1jNPsETvwGqCbmmY0bAywM?si=0a48d4b0a30c4bf8) popped up on my Release Radar, I've been re-listening to a lot of Puppet
- Thanks to JP I'm now on Bluesky, but I've not started collating my follows - lemme know if you're over there!
- Had a nice afternoon on the conservatory sofa with Morph while Cookie was out at daycare
- DMD and Renovate helped with an incident this week, making it much easier to work out the effect of an issue with the version of a library in use, and then get them updated. I need to update [my article about one-off Renovate runs](https://www.jvt.me/posts/2022/12/12/renovate-one-off/) cause I don't need the overhead I set up in that post
- Tried the chicken satay skewers and prawn crackers from Jasmine Inn down the road, which weren't too bad, but not quite as good as Wandering Dragon
- In dependency-management-data world
  - Created a [-contrib repo](https://gitlab.com/tanna.dev/dependency-management-data-contrib/)
  - Shipped dmd-web at work, which has already had a load of benefit and got a lot more folks interested and able to try it out
  - Added functionality to allow adding banners/custom metadata to the web app
  - Started looking at what'd be needed to work with importing SBOMs, so I can start ingesting Snyk and GitHub data in a better way
  - Trying to do as much stuff as possible that may be handy while I've still got access to Deliveroo's data, as it's still better than [my example data](https://gitlab.com/tanna.dev/dependency-management-data-example/)
