A pretty intense start to the year with a four day week filled with Cookie being a bit poorly, the weight of the performance review cycle and addressing issues out of the CircleCI breach.

- Woke up on Monday to find that my analytics had stopped working ~2300 the night before. Very weird, and couldn't find the root cause in any logs, but a restart of php-fpm seemed to solve it.

- Had a big walk at Blidworth
  - hid from her as joke
-

 Cookie vom not eating no go walk
 digging on the mountain side and vom into
 poorly bark when walk in but then back to bed
 lots more vom
- vom on rug


- Better clippers for nails
- Morph managed to bite my nose
- Dreamed about moving a nuclear warhead, after the binging of Jack Ryan ðŸ˜…

- Spotify data
- Cookie's been a bit of a nightmare today, not napping.
- Cookie's been super cute and sleepy, maybe because she's been poorly, but ðŸ¤ž also because that's who she is now
- FOsdem

- Feedback
  - lots of sugar
  - standing
  - [Shelter - Flowidus](https://open.spotify.com/track/2pqFghgcLFEnrfkVoYqJBl?si=0a19c9eff4954ef4) gave me some energy

- Got our new rainbow rug and put it in the bedroom

- My Pixel Watch froze
- Got some mineral oil and re-oiled the chopping boards
- Got some new cool PJs from Cat for Christmas

- Cookie barking at Morph by water
- Cookie fallen into the gap in the footstool
- Finally got to dig into why my AWS bills have been higher than usual - LB
