A busy week revolving around the very good DevOpsDays London 👏🏼

- Spoke at the Go lightning talks at work about dependency-management-data, as a practice run for DevOpsDays London
  - Got some good interest, even finding some use cases in the past that it would've been very useful for flagging a few internal apps affected by the same bug
  - Set up the repo's infrastructure, and will see about getting it set up to be regularly updating
- Made some big updates to [my /elsewhere/](/elsewhere/) page, which I'm quite happy with, and were well timed before the conference
- With DevOpsDays now out of the way, I need to start prepping for DDD East Midlands in two weeks - this time with a new talk I've never done 😱
- [Made my first contribution to GitLab](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/cli/-/merge_requests/1340), through the `glab` CLI
- Had a couple of "decadent" lunches on the sofa while Cookie was at daycare, and then at Anna's parents, which was nice and meant we got to get through more of _Only Murders in the Building_
- Was a great couple of days at DevOpsDays London
  - Had a nice time at the speaker dinner, got a chance to meet some of the other speakers and have some social time before the event started, especially as we didn't know as many folks going this year
  - Had some nice chats with various folks at the conference, including a couple of (ex-)Nottingham folks!
  - I've made a good start with my writeup, but it probably won't be ready till next week
  - My dependency-management-data talk went well, I felt like I rushed a couple of slides, but it seemed to come across well and my preview of the recording shows that it came across pretty well
  - Didn't make it to the afterparty on Thursday as the rain was _awful_ on top of being tired, so caught up on _Ahsoka_
  - Some good talks and conversations across the couple of days
  - Got a very nice meowy welcome from Morph, who was very happy to see us and enjoyed having some cuddles with us
  - Had some nice tacos at Casa Pastor with Carol before we headed home on Friday
- Cookie had a good few days at Anna's parents, but jumped into the canal and had to be rescued by Howard  😅
- She's been sleepy since she's gotten back, after a short walk around Woodthorpe, and then this morning we had a nice walk around Papplewick forest
- Was a bit worried when we got back and I'd received an invoice from Dell for a monitor and turns out it was a _very_ late invoice from August 😅
- Finally uninstalled the reddit is fun app, as it's taking up space and making me sad!
- I've dusted off my Oodie, as it's rather chilly right now 🥶

In dependency-management-data world a big week of updates as well as my talk:

- Had a good journey down to London, managing to add support for end-of-life checking to SBOMs for dependency-management-data in its entirety 👏
- Add support for filtering reports by platform/org/repo/owner
- Broke the build with the v0.42.0 release 😅 and learned some fun stuff about `replace`s
- Added deps.dev license + CVE lookups for SBOMs
- Added CVE information to Advisories reports
- Added a report for discovered licenses
- Added the ability to pick up on missing package data - for instance ecosystems that don't include the full dependency tree
- Got some very good feedback from my talk, with someone interested in contributing, a couple of engineers from a company, another interested in playing with it and I missed someone who came to the Elastic stand looking to chat to me about it

Watched:

- _Ahsoka_
- _Schitt's Creek_
- _Only Murders in the Building_
  - Called _part_ of the season 2 big reveal
  - We're unfortunately caught up now, with two episodes to go, and not enjoying having to wait 😅
