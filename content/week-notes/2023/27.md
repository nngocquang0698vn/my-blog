A nice week off, with a couple of nights away ü•∞

- Cookie got jumped by a dog on a walk, just before we left my parents', which was not good of the other dog's owner, and we think this week Cookie's been a bit apprehensive of seeing other dogs because of it
- With Twitter users receiving [rate limit exceeded](https://metro.co.uk/2023/07/01/what-does-rate-limit-exceeded-mean-on-twitter-19049877/) due to stupid ["reading limits"](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jul/01/twitter-applies-reading-limit-after-users-report-issues-with-platform) it was funny seeing what chaos folks were finding in it, including the fact that it's now super clear how there's an ad every 5 tweets
- Fun and confusing listening to the _My Favourite Murders_ Dubbed episodes, where it's been bleeped out
- Had a lovely couple of nights away at Hoar Cross Hall - was really nice to get away, switch off, get pampered, read, and just be the two of us for a bit
  - Started off with a very nice afternoon tea
  - Was nice to have some excellent food, mostly in the form of 3 course meals
  - Enjoyed the various nap rooms, which we sampled well, and especially enjoyed the heated water beds in the snooze room
  - Ended up getting an extra massage as there were some spare slots, and it was very good
  - May have napped a little in my last treatment, I seem to remember spluttering a lot
- My blog post about LeadDev is making progress but still got roughly a third of the talks still to finish writing up, so hopefully this week I'll be able to finish it off
- Been nice to have Control removed in _Apex Legends_, as I've been able to play a lot more Gun Game. But wasn't great that when it was disabled, everything stopped working for a few hours üòÖ
- Been chatting with the folks at Educative about writing some courses for them
- Bought my new monitor, a [Dell UltraSharp U2723QE](https://www.dell.com/en-uk/shop/dell-ultrasharp-27-4k-usb-c-hub-monitor-u2723qe/apd/210-bcxk/monitors-monitor-accessories)
- Been having a weird bug(?) in Disney+ where if we don't stop, go back to the menu, and then turn the TV off, Futurama is still playing in the background if we just turn the TV off ü§î
- Had a late night last night, watching videos of Cookie as a puppy and remembering just how chaotic life used to be üòÖ but also how cute she was and is
- Cat and Bernard got Bo üê∂ today and ü•∫ü•∞
- Cookie's been very needy this evening, not wanting me to be on my laptop and instead give her some attention ü•∫

In dependency-management-data world:

- had a bit of a brainworm for adding a web app, which is now live https://www.jvt.me/posts/2023/07/08/dmd-web/
  - Been fun + a little awkward setting up the basis for Go templating
  - Had a bit of a brainworm while we were away, so ended up looking up some bits
  - Was good to get it built before I go back to work, where we can then get it in use
- Had [a fun bug](https://gitlab.com/tanna.dev/dependency-management-data/-/merge_requests/63) this morning that was causing `NULL`s that then were breaking the CLI/web app
- Fixed [a bug](https://gitlab.com/tanna.dev/dependency-management-data/-/commit/d852692fc3b3ed4365128e61a8f82f5e11d9dbe8) that was affecting work's dependencies
- Ahead of [my talk at DevOpsNotts](https://www.meetup.com/devops-notts/events/293929326/) I've been doing some mental planning:
  - I'm gonna have to rework a fair bit of the slides I'd prepared - for my dry-run at work - as I've recently changed a few things that means the talk is somewhat out-of-date üòÖ
  - I'm planning on writing a "talk writeup" and a "TL;DR" post about it

- _Halt and Catch Fire_
