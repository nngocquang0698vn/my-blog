- A bird has been chilling outside of Anna's window, which Cookie's been finding _extremely_ exciting, and has been barking every time it pops up, which has been a bit annoying for us both ðŸ˜…
- Had a nice afternoon with Carol yesterday
- Rewriting my little hacky script for getting a list of issues GitLab issues, replacing the README generation with an SQLite database
  - Both because I love me some SQLite, and it's easier to see at-a-glance where issues are, but also so I can trim down the number of CI minutes I use on GitLab for not much benefit
- Been a stinky day at home today, as after a nice walk at Rushcliffe Cookie ended up rolling in some poo ðŸ’©
  - Tried cleaning her up a little, but she's still rather stinky
- Finally finished _It Didn't Start With You_
- Got my [Stimagz](https://www.stimagz.com/?bon_ref=2dW5lwrd) which have been really satisfying and a good stim toy
  - Even found I've been doing it in my head a few times, like in the car or before bed
- Made some good updates to DMD, introducing the ability to get the whole list of upcoming updates (backed by Renovate) so looking forward to giving it a go with some more data
- Although I'm still not quite "back to normal" with work, as it's only been a week since the redundancies, I did find it rewarding this week working on CRAPI, one of our more recent Go services, and found it quite nice to get back into things, as well as
- Found a local dog walker and looking forward to having her first walk this coming week
- Another week of Cookie being cuddly and cute ðŸ¥°
- Cookie had her 6 month checkup at the vet's and although didn't super enjoy it, was a good girl
