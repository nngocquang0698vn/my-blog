- My final week at Deliveroo!
  - Managed to get the last features out for dependency-management-data that I'd wanted to do when I still had direct access to the internal database and the ability to handle breaking changes
  - Was still shipping features - this time, not to DMD, but to our Terraform runner - about a half hour before I needed to wipe my laptop before it was collected ðŸ˜œ
  - Had some really nice leaving messages from my team and colleagues across the business, which is always nice to hear - and also great to see the result of the impact I've had over the last ~15 months!
  - Been weird this weekend not having my work laptop around to do OSS between games of Apex Legends
- Cookie joined us for my final team drinks, much to many of the call's excitement, and she was super cute and cuddly
- Mixed feelings leaving, but with some changes happening at the company this week, also glad ðŸ˜…
- Cookie's been a bit poorly over the weekend
  - First sign was when she wasn't really wanting to eat her biscuits on Friday afternoon, but she ate her wet food for dinner OK
  - Then overnight, we were up a few times with her, and she vommed at one point with basically undigested wet food
  - She's been a bit up-and-down, but hoping she feels better by tomorrow
  - It did mean that Morph was able to come into the living room a little easier, as although Cookie's still a bit territorial, she's also less energetic
  - While she's been feeling off we've been making some cooked chicken breasts for her, and she's started associating the sound of tubs opening with her getting chicken ðŸ˜¹
- Also had some other chances to have Morph in the living room this week which has been nice
- Found Morph hiding under the shed during a particularly bad set of rain, but called to him and he came in
- Had a bit too much thyme on a Gousto - including me pre-chopping it unnecessarily - which then meant it was a little difficult to eat, and I felt like I had some stuck in my throat for a day
- Windows has reported that - the cause of many BSODs recently - is due to a memory hardware issue, which is frustrating, and also funny that I haven't seen _any_ issues running on Linux, but fairly regularly hit it on Windows. Maybe the gaming I'm doing triggers the right conditions?
- My mind's been pretty busy this week (not even actively, just felt "busy") focussing on Friday as my last day - and trying to get the things done I can do and handed over - followed by my brain now focussing on Tuesday's [talk at DevOpsNotts](https://www.meetup.com/devops-notts/events/293929326/), after which I can start to think about the rest of my time off
  - Not managed to make as much progress with the talk as I'd hoped given Cookie's been feeling unwell, but got a couple of free days before the talk, and I've previously done a run-through so have most of it written
- Been nice to catch up with Rich for the first time in a while ðŸ˜Š
- Making some progress with investigating SBOM support for dependency-management-data for Snyk and GitHub, with some help from the folks at Snyk
- The internet has been particularly bad in the tail end of the week
