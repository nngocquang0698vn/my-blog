- The end of our holiday:
  - Was a bit of an odd last day, not really having too much time, and the bus to the airport being a little late, on top of the boarding passes not matching our names üò¨
  - Sleeping on my somewhat sunburnt side was a little bit annoying üòÖ The sun caught me during the beach day much quicker than I expected
  - Sad to be over, but starting to plan what's next üëÄ
- Started on fleshing out a "support me" page, taking strong inspiration from [Emila Smith's "support me" page](https://support.thisismissem.social/)
- Was nice to have Cookie back again, and she's mostly been very cute and cuddly
- My [_How we reduced oapi-codegen's dependency overhead by ~84%_](https://www.jvt.me/posts/2023/10/23/oapi-codegen-v2-decrease/) post was featured in another Go newsletter üëè
- Nice coming back to work for only a three day week, with Friday being a shut-it-down day
  - Anna and I both had the day off, so we had a bit of a chilled one and then went over to DTR Customs to look at whether a fitted wardrobe situation would work well with the bedroom - will see what the quote's like, but having talked about it, we're probably looking at doing it more ourselves
- Starting to bulk cook - we managed to finish off the Cook lunches, so though this may be a good way to handle lunches in the future
  - Spent some time looking for Gochujang, but fortunately found some despite starting to think about substitutions
  - Got "random checked" at the Smart Shop checkout, but unfortunately the staff member ended up doing something(?) that ended up us needing to have a "full" rescan, so then they ended up re-scanning everything in our bags, taking them out very unceremoniously, and being a bit concerned about the bananas and the pizzas
- Been enjoying the üçø of watching the trainwreck that was OpenAI's board firing Sam Altman
- Had a massage on Friday as I didn't get a chance to have one over the holiday
- Been listening to [All You Ever Wanted - Sub Focus Remix](https://open.spotify.com/track/0BCLPOgXpSRepCXkjBNDe1?si=9cIwVIZAQnOu_TTKvtJF1A) and [_LIFT YOU UP_](https://open.spotify.com/track/2BRLxNhZT3HEKRINTCDBcm) _a lot_
- Had a nice breakfast with Morph one day
- Was nice attending the first OWASP Dependency Track community meeting, and felt a little bit like the wind had come out of my sails with dependency-management-data, as there's a lot of overlap there ü§î
- Been enjoying listening to the [Nitroboost playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DWWpHR8v2FGW4) as a source of some more high-energy songs
- Had an OK dentist visit (thankfully!)
- Finally trimmed the _hundreds_ of tabs in my mobile Firefox down, finding quite a few things I wanted to do, a few things that the time had passed to action them, and a _lot_ of duplicate tabs, or things that I was researching when mobile
- [Built `snyk-export-sbom`](https://www.jvt.me/posts/2023/11/15/snyk-export-sbom/)
- Been starting on quite the backlog of podcasts over the last week or so, there've been some good ones!
- The cellar was rather flooded before we went away, but has gone down quite a lot since then
- Finally, posting these! I'd wondered about trying to get them done earlier in the week but didn't want to push myself or make it a demand. On our first full day back, I needed to get a CfP submission in for FOSS Backstage, and then later in the week it was a case of having chilled evenings

Played:

- _Apex Legends_ - only a couple of games to play around with [the Three Strikes LTM](https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/apex-legends/news/post-malone-event) which was fun
- _Titanfall2_ - although unfortunately it lost my keybindings so I spent a few games mistakenly meleeing instead of throwing a grenade, etc
- _Super Mario Odyssey_ - I feel there's been a bit more replayability / still quite a lot to unlock, whereas _Super Mario Wonder_ is a bit "done" now

Watched:

- _Loki_
- _Friends_
- _The Continental_
- _Life in Pieces_
  - Sad it's ended, and cancelled before it could've resolved some of the plot points
