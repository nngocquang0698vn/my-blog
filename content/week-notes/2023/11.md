A two-day work week, with three days off for my birthday.

- Had a bit too much of a lie in on Monday as I'd turned my alarm off and slept in until almost 9 🥱
- Had some very cute mornings with Cookie being cuddly, and some evenings of Cookie being cuddly. She's turning into such a lil' cutie 🥰
- With the news about Docker changing how "Free Teams" worked, I wrote a post about using DMD to work out how you use Docker - didn't get much traction on Lobsters/Hacker News, but hoping it'll provide some value to folks. At the very least, I'll be using it at work
- Made some good [DMD](https://dmd.tanna.dev) changes this week, which I've been quite happy with and have made some good tweaks to the way it works and is used
  - Next step is to get DMD running against my personal projects and maybe some other folks' public GitHub and GitLab repos, so I have a source of real-world data to query, especially if I'm no longer at Deliveroo
- Had some good attempts from Morph to come into the living room again, he's been staying a bit longer which is good, and not being dissuaded by Cookie barking / chasing him away
- Finished _Superstore_ - when we were last watching it (in 2021), we got to the last two episodes but didn't finish them. This time we did, and it was a good end to the series
- Put my headphones onto charge one day before bed, which triggered Cookie to keep barking at my office for some reason 😅
- Planned to get a Burg on Wednesday but they were closed until late 😱
- [Got some Doughnotts from my team](https://www.jvt.me/mf2/2023/03/ufztb/) for my birthday, which were very tasty and appreciated
- Tom came to set up the hall shelves + coat pegs, and while he was here did the second blind in the living room so things are looking much nicer now 👏
- Was nice to have Carol and Jonathan over for dinner on Thursday night - it was a bit of a late notice but really glad they were able to come
  - Had a nice evening chatting and chilling
  - Had a good amount of wine, and felt it a little bit the next day 😅
- Had a bit of a chilled birthday, feeling a bit down with the pending redundancy news and a lot of not knowing. We'd hoped to have some time away, but didn't feel it'd be a good idea with the shadow of it hanging over us
  - As of 0930(ish) on Wednesday I'll have an answer 🤞🏼
- Bought _Deathloop_ after Carol had mentioned it on Thursday and been enjoying it so far, although I'm finding it a bit tough on the Steam Deck - when handheld it's hard to see everything on the screen, and I'm finding it tough to play with a controller, but still persisting
- Hoped to watch _The Accountant_ on my birthday, but realised too late it was on my Amazon account and we couldn't watch it on the TV 😅
- Headed out for lunch today at Homemade - without Cookie! - which was nice 😄
- Had some great support from one of the Jenkins devs on Job DSL, helping modernise and sort out a few of the outstanding big issues which has relieved a good chunk of pressure that's been bubbling away in the background
