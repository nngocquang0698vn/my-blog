The final four-day weekend for a while:

- A pretty chilled bank holiday seeing Carol
  - Unfortunately missed Emma and Andrew
  - Got a very nice welcome from an excited Juno and gave him some good cuddles
- Back to on-call
  - Was the first time since last year, which was nice as we'd paused it while the redundancies were ongoing
  - Was also my first shift since we've dropped down to 3 days which was nice and felt like much less of an impact on the week's goings on
  - Used my on-call allowance for good soup one day which was nice
  - Had my first incident but fortunately in-hours and reasonable to remediate
- Migrated from Vimscript to Lua based configuration, with the help of [kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim)
- Had some fun (😬) fighting Sorbet and sorbet-rails
- The new(ish) vegetable peeler caught my finger again, so had a bit of a painful couple of days
- We were excited to get Chapati Junction but then got an order cancellation, and we've not been able to order since 😱
- Had some good chat about AI and ethics at Friday drinks
- Got a perfect Asda pizza 🍕😋
- They say "imitation is the sincerest form of flattery", <span class="h-card"><a class="u-url" href="https://byvernacchia.com/">Alex</a></span> had `jvt.me`s on his whiteboard in the background of his video 😹
- Got a Nandos wrap kit, and was pretty wild to find they only gave 4 wraps 😅
- Started some tidying in the garden to get it into a better place in the meantime of getting the gardeners in, and about 2 minutes into trimming the chaos that is the garden the strimmer's blade - the last one I had 😅 - flew off, and that was the end of the gardening (until new ones arrive tomorrow)
- Listened to [Bloc Party - Tulips (Minotaur Shock Remix)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzGcH2uEECY) because it popped into my head, and immediately got flashbacks to reading _Leviathan Falls_
- The DMD restructure at work has worked very nicely - after solving a couple of particularly awkward bugs I'd introduced - and it's been great to see us getting real-time access to all the data of current data and all pending updates

Watched:

- _Ted Lasso_
