- Turns out my body wasn't quite ready for a full week, so ended up taking Monday to rest up
- Did some bits in the garden to try and get it a bit more manageable before the gardeners can come, mainly getting some strimming done so Cookie has a bit of room to go to the loo, and we can get to the compost bin
- Nipped out at lunch to pick up some new strimmer wire, because about 15 minutes into strimming I lost the last blade I had ðŸ˜…
- I'd ordered some on Amazon but didn't bother with the "Monday by 1200" option as I didn't expect to be off, so was a bit annoying we had to get some before a stack of them arrived
- And then later found a stack of them in the garage, just not the obvious places I'd looked
- Having seen that Gousto this week had Thai-Style Peanut Chicken Thigh Baked Wraps, I was very excited to do them on Monday - having thought about it most of the day - and they were good ðŸ˜‹ but I ended up making some of my own satay sauce to go on it, as there's never enough
- Been enjoying my new Neovim setup
- Got a bit of a brainworm with writing [an article about checking Go binary types](https://www.jvt.me/posts/2023/05/15/go-parse-binary-architecture/)
- Off the back of it got [my first proposal raised with Go](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/60198), and looking forward to seeing what the process is like, especially as it's one I'd be up for contributing
- In the dependency-management-data world:
  - Noticed that DMD's release archives haven't been publishing for a while ðŸ˜¬ Was related to some changes I did to remove CGO setup, woops!
  - Now we've got all the pending updates Renovate can see for DMD, it's been super powerful for getting a view of what work we need to be doing in the coming months
  - Added support to DMD for AWS infrastructure - largely based on my previous work on aws-lambda-endoflife - to get more understanding about when deprecation/end-of-life timelines are coming for Lambda, ElastiCache and RDS which was good, and it's nice to have a handle SQLite data dump for them all
  - Making more progress on writing up my talk
- Had a bit of an investigation into Wayland, but not sure it's quite ready for what I want to use
- After a decade of using Podcast Addict, I've finally started paying for it
- Had some fun (read: sarcasm) trying to get Sorbet up-to-date on some of our projects to run on the latest MacOS version, hitting many more issues than I wanted to, but managed to get it minimally updated, and more substantial upgrades (including Tapioca) may have to wait
- Huge fan of <span class="h-card"><a class="u-url" href="https://ripixel.co.uk">James King</a></span>'s latest creation [didyouknowjamiehasawebsite.co.uk](http://didyouknowjamiehasawebsite.co.uk) - trolling me at work, despite no longer working here ðŸ˜¹ - and how on brand it is to have a website to say "I have a website" ðŸ˜…
- Mixed Reese's with (fake) Baileys, which didn't really work, and decided I was going to try making a milkshake properly ðŸ‘€
- Turns out making milkshakes are very easy, and made a very good Reese's milkshake and a not-quite-right Creme Egg milkshake, neither of which contained any milk so were a bit heavy ðŸ˜‹
- Shoutout at the Tech Huddle from Lee was nice ðŸ˜„
- Finally got around to finishing _Star Trek: Deep Space 9_, which was a very good and emotional end, and now sets me up to start watching _Picard_
- Been listening to [Gryffin & Elley DuhÃ© - Forever (Lizzy Jane Remix)](https://open.spotify.com/track/6KFV58emq26sUOC7lZrELP?si=9bc586a3eadc49cd) a lot this week, and [the song radio playlist from Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1E8M8qnRi9EiMg), and got a lot of good new songs to add to my library
- A solo weekend without Anna - who went to see BeyoncÃ© in Scotland ðŸ¥³
  - Aside from after Anna had left, Cookie's been a very good girl, very chill and napping around the house a lot, plopped outside in the sun
  - Had some nice lie-ins - after her 0700 "I need to go downstairs but not to the loo, I just want to go down for no reason" - and some late morning walks which has been nice
  - Been a nice chill time together
- Had a fun game of Apex on World's Edge at Thermal Station where I dropped onto the top. After poking several of the teams below, the team that won all the fighting below tried to get me by using an evac balloon - however as soon as they started ascending, I jumped down and onto it too, flying away from them ðŸ˜¹ Very funny. They eventually caught me after several jump balloons and poking them, but was a fun chase
- Got round to making the Nandos wrap mix from last week and dang, medium spice was much hotter than I remember ðŸ˜…
