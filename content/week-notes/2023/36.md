- Got National Grid round to sort our earth connection, so hopefully Octopus can come back again to fit a smart meter
- Fly.io must have had a bad deploy or similar as I couldn't log in or deploy, but glad to see they recovered quickly
- Was my X-School at Elastic, which is our monthly onboarding cohort, which gave us more depth to the company, we got to hear from Shay Banon (co-founder, CTO) and Ashutosh Kulkarni (CEO), and got a chance to have breakout groups with some folks from all over the company which was cool
- [Shipped better Dependabot + SBOM support for dependency-management-data](https://www.jvt.me/posts/2023/09/10/dmd-sbom-dependabot/)
- Was happy to have my slides finished ahead of DevOpsDays London in a couple of weeks, although I need to update them again now I've added SBOM support
- Spent a chunk of one day digging into making it possible to get a validator for Backstage configuration in CI - using the same configuration as we use for yaml-language-server - before finding [yaml-ls-check](https://github.com/InoUno/yaml-ls-check) 👏
- Yesterday was two years to the day of me posting my salary and [my post about it](https://www.jvt.me/mf2/2023/09/tiemq/) has got some good visibility
- Got a release out for Job DSL after a request to get it shipped, which is the first time in a while - as thankfully Basil's been doing excellent work on it
- Dave and Faye got their own dog, Jasper 🥺
- Had a nice walk around Bestwood Country Park lake with Carol and Juno, although we weren't prepared for it to get dark so early 😅
- Rakki Rakkas takeaway afterwards was very good 😋
- Had a nice walk round Blidworth Woods on Saturday, luckily avoiding the heat aside from a little scorching stretch
  - As we arrived a couple of dogs jumped out of someone's car and were racing around causing chaos, but luckily nothing went wrong and they got caught before long
- Been fun spending time with Morph in his tree, who's extra meowy, likes rubbing his head against it, and being crabby when I (playfully) tried to poke him with a small stick
- Got Asda pizza 😋
- Got some new Forthglade biscuits, but Cookie didn't wanna eat them until Morph came over to try and eat them 😅
- Been pretty toasty this week 🥵 Especially overnight, and we've needed the fans on
- Cookie was so sleepy today that she's been trying to lick her biscuits out of her biccie ball 🥰
- All the long walks and the heat this weekend has finally meant we've had an evening without Cookie barking at us - not super sustainable though 😅
