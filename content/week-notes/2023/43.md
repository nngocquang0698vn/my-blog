- Woke up on Monday not feeling particularly great after feeling it coming over the weekend, so took Monday as a sick day, and a chilled day definitely helped
  - This weekend I've been feeling under the weather again ðŸ¤§ Hoping that it'll be out of me in the next couple of days
- Anna was away for a couple of days with work, so on Tuesday Cookie had a good day at daycare, and then was super sleepy in the evening, sleeping on the footstool most of the evening, which was nice as I was attending the OpenUK meetup, which was good. I've got some notes, but not yet gotten around to writing them up
- Had a decadent lunch on Tuesday, with Morph on the sofa and playing Super Mario Wonder ðŸ¤©
- Morph's been getting lots of time with us in the living room, and he's been really enjoying it, as have we ðŸ¥° And Cookie's also been very good with him, aside from a couple of outbursts
  - I even played a little with him this afternoon with one of his mouseys
- A couple of nights this week I've woken up to Cookie be cuddled up in my arm ðŸ¥°
- Phaeleh dropped a new album without me noticing, but very much enjoying the fact that [Dreaming](https://open.spotify.com/track/6xaeRVQDIFdhOpgupyNQu9) is on it, which is a song I've heard a few times on [his YouTube mix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZC042EuFHxs) but it was an Untitled song
- We ordered a collection of Cook lunches which have been a nice alternative to planning lunches, and it's been fun cause now we have the fun of deciding what nice lunch we want to have. Luckily it all _just_ fit in the freezer, as we'd not prepped it at all ðŸ«£
- With a bit of brain free since TechMids, I've gotten around to writing up a few smallish posts, including how we reduced `oapi-codegen`'s dependency sprawl
  - ... which I'm looking forward to chatting about tomorrow at the Go Lightning Talks at work
- Prepared `oapi-codegen`'s last release ahead of this week's v2 bump
- Had a nice afternoon with Carol and Juno at Pawsome Pasture hanging and getting a bit muddy ðŸ˜…
  - Cookie enjoyed digging in the mud, running around, digging in the sandpit, and playing and chasing
  - She had a pretty muddy, but fun, time and still has a very cute muddy nose
- Bought a Humble Bundle for some programming books, and have been inundated with many emails from them this week ðŸ™„
- Been playing around with Snyk this week, ahead of using it a bit more at work, and using the data with dependency-management-data
- Tried Lidl's versions of Gu which was fine, but think I'd prefer the real thing if I'm buying
- Officially joined the Open Source Working Group at work ðŸŽ‰
- Forgot to `git push` these last night ðŸ˜…

In dependency-management-data:

- Been seeing a lot of interest in the docs site this week ðŸ‘€
- Made some progress towards [supporting OSS Review Toolkit](https://gitlab.com/tanna.dev/dependency-management-data/-/issues/206)
- Following Lorna's talk at TechMids, I ended up looking into broken links on dependency-management-data's site, and found quite a few broken internal links which wasn't good ðŸ™ˆ
- Added support for tracking "sensitive packages" and avoiding lookups
- Documented how to use ðŸ‘† as well as how to get the repo bootstrapped
- Upgraded renovate-graph to Renovate v37

Played:

- _Apex Legends_
- _Super Maro Wonder_
  - Finished story mode ðŸ«£ Been playing a fair bit this week, but still feel like it was a shorter game than I was expecting - I've definitely still got a fair way till 100%, and there's several "special worlds" to go for, too

Watched:

- _Loki_
- _Kim's Convenience_
- _The Crown_
- _Life in Pieces_
- _John Wick 4_
- _Futurama_
