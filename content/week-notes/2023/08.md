- Kicked off the week with an every so slightly themed retro with [Phaeleh - Moving On](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gNQc7L1odk) and [Yoe Mase - Getaway Car](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oacE0SWpR4)
- Had a couple of games of Team Deathmatch in _Apex Legends_ this week, one where I was playing a good bit of a hide-and-seek in a 1v1 just to keep the win (as up until then I had most of my team playing), or today when, again, most of the team left
- After cooking one night I looked down and saw a couple of my fingers looking a little odd. Turns out the new (carrot) grater had ever so slightly trimmed my skin ðŸ˜…
- Found out that I've never actually finished the final season of _Community_ so as we've been rewatching it, the last couple of episodes were a nice ending, `#6SeasonsAndAMovie` aside
- With consultation starting on Wednesday, I thought that watching _Office Space_, which was rather on-the-nose, but a fun watch, especially while I was [debugging Renovate issues](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate/discussions/20584)
- The `dmd` CLI is now in a good place, and was cool to get cross-compilation working with CGO
- To make it easier to consume the new auto-building (via `dmd`) database that we've got at work, I've added a new `roo dmd` CLI which I'm already using heavily ðŸ™Œ
- Tried the custard cream milkshake from Fireaway pizza (which we got free) which was fairly custard cream-y but would probably try the other options next time
- [Sorted out my slow site builds](https://www.jvt.me/mf2/2023/02/7aq79/)
- Morph's been spending more time in the living room, or at least attempting to before Cookie gets a bit rambunctious
  - But he's also been rather like a yo-yo as he kept coming in, maybe getting some cuddles and then leaving again
- Got a very deep clean car wash for the first time since "the paint incident", and have been a bit more careful about putting Cookie's crate back in to not damage the seats as much
- Not played the event for AdVenture Capitalist as I've won the last 3 in a row but been disappointed with the rewards so thought I'd take a pause on obsessively playing ðŸ˜…
- Cookie got barked awake when watching _Community_ and Britta snored ðŸ’€
- Had fun watching Morph have a go at trying to eat out of one of Cookie's puzzle feeders, who was more interested than concerned

Watched:

- _Community_
- _Star Trek: Deep Space 9_
- _Loki_
- _Black Panther: Wakanda Forever_
