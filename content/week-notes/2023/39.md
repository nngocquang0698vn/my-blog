A few days on my own while Anna was away for work, and some mixed feelings about how Cookie was ðŸ˜…

- Made some progress on my talk for DDD East Midlands next week and then re-reading my abstract and realising I've gone a little off base ðŸ˜¹
- My Oodie is much nicer now it's been washed, although sad that I'm also needing to wear it, with the weather getting worse
- Goose Fair has started, so it's:
  - Surprisingly loud, even down by ours
  - Impacted the takeaway options we've got
- Cookie's rather bashed my nose with an aggressive play, but hopefully will settle down in a bit
- Saw Blaine yesterday on our walk, who was in his garden and _trembling_ with excitement to come and say hey, but instead just wanted to carry around his ball
- Had a nice day coworking in town with Carol on Monday
- Cookie's hurt one of her paws so we've not been on any significant walks this weekend, and have been trying to stop her licking it so much
- Although he always tries to tell us that his food is empty, Morph's actually been right for a change, so think he missed most of a meal before we noticed
- Spent the evening upgrading my Renovate instance to the new Community Edition version - migrating from Renovate On Prem
- A very good Discover Weekly from Spotify, with most of the songs being great choices
  - [XLR8 - Audioscribe Remix](https://open.spotify.com/track/2Xu2mAJi414YjBvkUvEr9g) has been the most replayed all week, gelling well with [Focus](https://open.spotify.com/track/6uUW59D5sO1Y3mZVZNcEeg?si=e72b9b2574264209)
- Tweaked my push notifications service (for Webmentions) to improve a few things
- Spent the weekend clearing out my tweets with [Tweetus Deletus](https://www.jvt.me/posts/2023/09/30/tweetus-deletus/)
- Had a good chat with someone from the Pediatric Cardiac Bioengineering Laboratory at Harvard
- On Monday's walk slipped quite bad on a particularly mossy part of one of the pavements - Cookie didn't seem too fussed by it, but my arms didn't look great ðŸ˜¬
- Cookie's been chasing Morph a fair bit, still
- Cookie's had the all clear from the vet's ahead of this Wednesday's spaying ðŸ¤ž
- Hacktoberfest began today, but unlike previous years I've not been rushing to complete it. I feel a little less overly motivated to contribute given it's digital-only rewards, and the lack of scarcity means I'll get the rewards if I can, but it's much less pressing

In dependency-management-data:

- Spent some time looking into the Mend APIs and chatting about whether I'd be able to build any proprietary extensions to DMD that would build on top of their APIs
- Noticed GitLab's SBOM support, and [blogged about how to use it with DMD](https://www.jvt.me/posts/2023/09/27/dmd-gitlab/)
- Fixed a TODO note in my "getting started with DMD" that I didn't notice ðŸ˜…

Watched:

- _Ahsoka_
- _Schitt's Creek_
  - ðŸ¥°
- _Only Murders in the Building_
- _Picard_
  - Finally finished it
