Another four day week, coming off the back of a four day weekend 👏

- Had a massive brainworm this week with real-time updates for DMD, starting over the weekend, resulting in:
  - Playing around with container image based Lambda functions
  - Had some fun playing with a mix of Typescript and Go Lambdas, and working out the right combination of IAM privileges to allow push/pull from Eventbridge
  - Hitting [a (_very_ frustrating) bug(?) with `fetch`](https://github.com/nodejs/undici/issues/2110) leading to odd errors
  - But managed to get it working today (after some debugging and trying to reproduce the issue without much luck) for fully real-time data updates, and a more resilient setup than the previous setup 👏
- Cookie had a nice walk on Friday afternoon with our dog walker
- Finally got the garden assessment done and looking forward to getting it into a better shape 🤞🏼
- [Our first vote with Cookie](https://www.jvt.me/mf2/2023/05/wz9fr/), which was somewhat OK, but she did not like us going in one-by-one to vote
  - Picked up an ice cream on the way home which was nice
- Went out to Slice N Brew for Carol's birthday which was nice 🍕🍷🍺😋
  - We left Cookie with a couple of chews and some food, and she was OK for a bit, until she wasn't 😅 Managed to get inside without being somassively mauled, and she surprisingly managed to settle not too long before bed
- Went to Homemade for lunch today, and aside from other dogs being quite interested / barking at Cookie, she was pretty good and we managed to eat in peace and was nice to be out
- Morph ate a wasp 😅
- Cookie chased off a chonky cat the other day, but it was a little too chonky to jump up the fence, so ended up hiding up a tree until I was able to get her back inside
- Heardle officially closed which is sad, as it's one fewer game to play each day
- Cookie's been a bit of a mix of annoying and needy and this weekend has come into season so somewhat explains it
- Spent a bit of time yesterday looking at trying to make the joint account easier to work with, but unfortunately there don't seem to be many joint accounts out there that allow the ability to get online payments + direct debits taken out of savings pots 🤔
- Got a few blog posts to write that I've not gotten around to - including an exciting guest post for someone else's blog 😱 - hoping to get round to them this week
