A four day week, with Friday off for an extended four day weekend:

- Was good to catch up on some of my messages from the last few months, in particular caught up with Tim, a friend in the Open Source community, which was nice
- Accidentally found a hack for Heardle to listen to the full song without skipping ahead 😅 with Heardle shutting down in a week or so, it's probably not worth reporting upstream
- Voted on the talks I'd like to see at DDD East Midlands - was a bit of a tough one, but got it down to 10 from 39 😅
- Booked a talk with DevOpsNotts, which hopefully should be announced in the coming week 🤞 Excited to get back into speaking again
- Been playing around with CSS with my CV - learning how dark mode works, as well as restructuring some of the CSS and the design. I've not yet finished the changes, but hopefully this week it'll look a lil' different and be more styles owned by me, rather than Moez' original design
- [The possible Amazon breach](https://www.jvt.me/mf2/2023/04/fw45t/) was pretty disruptive, but managed to rotate everything pretty quickly
- Cookie's been rather frustrating this week 😬 Been a pretty tough week with her while Anna's been out, and with the cleaners on Friday
- Been playing a lot of _Cat Snack Bar_, and this afternoon I managed to get to the second level in the event 👏 first time I've done it, and got some good loot from it
- Been fun getting back to _Love is Blind_, with season 3 that we didn't watch at the time
- Spent the week trying to fight with some issues I've been seeing around Renovate running out of disk space, but unfortunately looks like it didn't seem to work
- Managed to get my dailies finished for _Apex Legends_ a week or so before the season ends which is good cause I thought I wouldn't be able to make it
- Nice to have my parents here for most of the weekend:
  - Went to the Blue Diamonds garden centre in East Bridgeford
    - Popped to the pet shop first, and Cookie had such a great time sniffing, trying to steal chews and bits of animal off the shelves 😅 Got her some new toys, lots of chews, and got our first dog mugs (from <span class="h-card"><a class="u-url" href="https://www.sophieallport.com/">Sophie Allport</a></span>) since becoming dog owners
    - The garden centre was absolutely huge, and some really nice stuff
    - Cookie was _amazing_ and it was a testament to how far she's come over the last year
    - Had a nice chilled lunch - with a small chew for Cookie
    - Got some nommy brownies, a sausage roll and some Scotch Eggs, but could've bought one of everything in the farm shop because there was _so much_ tasty looking food
  - Spent some time in the conservatory chilling in the sun, and watching Morph chirp at the birds, and chase a squirrel that happened to run into the garden, but fortunately didn't catch it
  - Re-made a Gousto from this week for us all
  - Got to stroke a very chonky black Cat while on a walk with Dad, which was cute
  - A very good Rakki Rakkas 😋 Took Cookie with us - in the Tesla - which was a good first attempt and she seemed to find it an alright first trip, although wasn't pleased when I jumped out to pick up the food in the _torrential_ rain 😓
  - Had a good walk at the park this morning, seeing Cookie's friends Henry and Theo for a good runaround, but unfortunately just missed Nellie. Saw a super gorgeous Corgi with long hair, and Cookie didn't completely lose it when she saw me stroking them
  - Cookie's been so sleepy since Mum and Dad left, sleeping off the excitement of yesterday's trip to the garden centre, in the Tesla, and today's park trip
- Had some KFC from Miss Korea tonight which was good 😋
- Had some very cute times with Cookie, too

Watched:

- _Loot_
- _Love is Blind_ (season 3)
- _Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency_

Reading:

- _The Magician's Apprentice_ (got about 20 minutes left to read 😅)
