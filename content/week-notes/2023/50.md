- A week of leftovers 😋
- I've also unfortunately been ill this week 😷🤒 but it's not (at least infectious) COVID so that's good so far
  - Really don't enjoy it, or how my body feels, and having to suddenly rush to the nearest tissues to blow my nose
  - Been a bit achey - also due to my massage - as well as having temperature up-and-down
- For work, scripted a `rofi` helper for managing my VPN connections + opening up the authentication for it (as it's vendor specific, on top of OpenVPN)
- Built my Mobius Lego Brickheadz and ordered the missing pieces for Anna's Sylvie and Captain Marvel, and then realised I still have a couple of missing pieces after that, for my Loki 😅
- Trying out a new Vim colourscheme - I'm going from [Gruvbox](https://vimcolorschemes.com/morhetz/gruvbox) to [srcery-vim](https://vimcolorschemes.com/srcery-colors/srcery-vim), which as you can tell from the screenshots, are _almost exactly the same_ so yay me for branching out 😹 If it works out, it'll become my CLI colour-scheme too and then likely will follow forwards to my site, too!

- Started [reaching out to folks](/mf2/2023/12/wz7ll/) around getting a logo for dependency-management-data, as well as maybe oapi-codegen and some stickers for my laptop for jvt.me
  - Posted on LinkedIn, but immediately regretted + deleted it after getting a _tonne_ of connection requests
- With only ~week left of my trial of Mend's SCA platform, I've decided I should really get my butt in gear and get my integrations for dependency-management-data set up
- Was targeted by my first bit of Fediverse spam 👏
- Made some tweaks to `serve`, including adding some handy log output

- Last Shut it Down Day of the year was fairly chill, not super productive, but also given I've been under the weather, it's been OK
  - Had a nice - albeit somewhat (good) painful massage
- Got Asda pizza 😋 And saw [a wonderful sunset](/mf2/2023/12/4jnl5/) on the way home
- Missed having a Chinese takeaway to celebrate my [Appendixaversary](https://www.jvt.me/posts/2019/12/16/second-appendixaversary/)
- Made a good bit of progress through my TODO list in my Keep note, at least in terms of triage, if not actually doing things
- For the _second year running_ I have submitted my audio clip to the Changelog's State of the Log 😅🫣 This year I thought I'd be much more prepared - even asking over a week ago when it was due - but a mix of misreading the dates, and a bit of ol' executive dysfunction made it late. Hoping to still be squeezed in at the end, again 🫣
- Had a fair bit of traffic to my [blog post about getting an OIDC thumbprint](https://www.jvt.me/posts/2022/05/06/oidc-thumbprint/) - maybe related to some stuff that GitLab were doing - and was appreciative of having someone send me a thank you for the post 💸
- Had a nice catch-up with ShiHan

In dependency-management-data:

- Made a solid start on implementing on [repo metadata](https://gitlab.com/tanna.dev/dependency-management-data/-/issues/266), but put it on pause as I want to make sure I'm actually implementing the right thing, with the right pieces of data
- Managed to get my Renovate runner (on Fly.io) back up and running, and cleared down the pending dependency updates
- Been confirmed that I'm [going to be speaking at State of Open Con](/mf2/2023/12/t2hns/) about it 👏
- Heard about [Guac](https://guac.sh/) on [an episode of Software Engineering Daily](https://www.jvt.me/mf2/2023/12/j7g0h/) and am going to have a play around with it to see how it could interplay with dependency-management-data, or whether there's anything that can cross-polinate
