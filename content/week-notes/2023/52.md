Christmas week ðŸŽ… and New Year's Eve ðŸŽ†

- A lovely Christmas day - good company and food
  - Got some lovely presents ðŸ¥° and some happy folks with their own presents
- The box of Heroes we took to my parents had _full size_ Twirls ðŸ˜±
- Cookie was super sleepy and cuddly while we were sitting in my parents' reading room, coming over for cuddles ðŸ¥°
- Been playing around with Jupyter notebooks for querying + visualising SQLite data, with the idea of making it a handy way to collaborate and share dependency-management-data queries
- Had a nice catchup with James and Aash, and a nice one with Mihaela, too
- Had Anna's parents over for the Cook Christmas leftovers, and a freshly cooked roast chicken
- Updated some oapi-codegen related posts to make sure they're up-to-date with the v2 release and the newer configuration formats
- After a while of meaning to bleed the radiators, finally got around to doing it and realised that I don't think we have a radiator key handy ðŸ˜…
- Looking forward to after midnight when I can request my Spotify history, to do my personal data crunching for [Music in Review](/music-in-review/), and see how it gels with what my Spotify Wrapped says, as well as get my site's analytics in review for [Site in Review](/site-in-review/)
- As I'm writing these, Cookie is hiding and Morph has just walked into the living room (!!!) and got onto the other sofa, and is sleeping happily there ðŸ¥°
- Had some good chicken satay from Lidl this week ðŸ˜‹

Happy new year folks ðŸ¥‚

Watched:

- _Friends_
- _Reacher_
- _Leave the World Behind_
  - [So good I even posted about it separately](https://www.jvt.me/mf2/2023/12/bsrh6/)
- _Bodies_
  - We binged this over the weekend - was very good! Well recommended if you enjoy SciFi/crime thrillers, and especially if you've watched _Dark_ or _1899_
- _Inside Man_
  - Good, but rather heavy
