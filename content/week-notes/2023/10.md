- Was fighting for top place in AdVenture Capitalist on Monday, but didn't quite get the top spot
- Finally gotten around to reading _ADHD 2.0_, which was recommended to me when I first announced my diagnosis
  - Managed to finish it in the day ðŸ˜… Yay for 2x speed
  - While listening to it, I then started thinking about how books-mf2 wasn't up and running (as it was still on the Heroku free tier, and therefore not running) and so would need to replatform it before I finished reading, because I wouldn't ever want to be unable to track my activities exactly
- Replatformed books-mf2 to Fly.io and rewrote it in Go
  - Gave me a good chance to play around with [Chi](https://github.com/go-chi/chi) instead of my usual [gorilla/mux](https://github.com/gorilla/mux), as I wanted a chance to play around with a Go `net/http` compatible router, instead of something like Echo or Gin
- Was very interesting listening to [the latest Go Time](https://changelog.com/gotime/268)
  - Spent a lot of the time thinking about how great it all sounded and that I wish I had tooling like that, and ideating how I'd end up building it myself
- Done a bit of publicising of DMD this week, hoping to get a bit more usage of it
- Cookie's been barking at / trying to open the cat flap
- Morph's been very good at coming into the living room this week, even after Cookie chases him away
  - He's been enjoying coming in through his secret door
  - Had my lunch with him on Wednesday while Cookie was at her playdate
- Had some very cute cuddles with Cookie, a few times on my office sofa ðŸ¥°
- While Anna was on a work trip, I was solo parenting with Cookie
  - Was mostly an OK week, considering Cookie's claw was still recovering and she wasn't able to go out on long walks, and then we had a tonne of snow ðŸŒ¨ that meant she couldn't go out much ...
  - ... not least because she then hurt her paw later in the week ðŸ˜³ And it's still recovering, but she seems to be doing better
  - We think it was Cookie's first experience of snow, because she was perplexed by the concept of it, but at least I managed to get some good videos of how cute she was with it
  - Cookie had a play date with Nelly which was very appreciated
  - Ended up getting 0 takeaways while Anna was gone, which was _not_ like me - I'd ended up getting all 4 Goustos, and a rack of ribs from Asda on Sunday, so there was a tonne of food to make. Managed to make it work by cooking in evenings and having leftovers for lunch, after Monday I cooked at lunch and found it a bit tight for time
- Got a little bit nerd sniped by working out how to work out if Twilio tokens are still active
- Had some very cute Friday morning cuddles with Cookie since Anna was back
- Accidentally locked Morph in the dining room on Friday, so couldn't make it to get his lunch ðŸ˜…
- Played some Jackbox at work for our Friday board games session which was fun
- Caught Morph licking Cookie's head yesterday which was very cute
- Handed over Renovate and Dependency Management Data at work, which I've been planning to do for a while, and glad to have had it done. Spent a good chunk of time prepping for handovers, and feel like it helped get my thoughts in order too
  - Also good future proofing for making sure that Product Security have some experience managing it if I do end up being made redundant ðŸ˜¬
- "The date" for finding out if I will be made redundant has slipped from 20th March to 22nd March, which is a bit frustrating
- Been interesting thinking abaout how it's been 3 years since the start of COVID lockdowns, and interesting to read back [Week Notes 20#11](https://www.jvt.me/week-notes/2020/11/) and [Week Notes 20#12](https://www.jvt.me/week-notes/2020/12/)
- Had a bit of a panic that I'd not written last week's notes, or that I'd missed a week, but turns out the dates were just confusing
- Got around to some maintenance for [cucumber-reporting-plugin](https://gitlab.com/jamietanna/cucumber-reporting-plugin/), after spotting an issue from a month ago of someone asking about updates, and spent a bit of time trying to work out why the upgrade to the latest version of Cucumber failed
- Made a few tweaks to renovate-graph
- Got our first Easter egg from Lidl ðŸ˜‹
- After a couple of months of our posters being ready to put up, we finally got around to putting them up
- Been feeling a bit ill this weekend, hoping that we're not coming down with another case of COVID, and that it's just a bad cold
- Cooked for lunch today ðŸ˜±
- Had a few emails this week about various things based off my blog, and was cool to chat to a few folks about different things
- Saw [Stimagz](https://www.stimagz.com/) on TikTok, and they seem pretty cool, so I've ordered a set to see what they're like ðŸ‘€
- Our neurodiversity community at work is thriving more than usual, which is really lovely ðŸ’œ
