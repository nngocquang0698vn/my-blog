- Been pretty chilly here this week, especially this weekend, so it's been nice having my thermals and actually layering up properly for a change, as well as having the heating on a little bit extra some nights
- My first week of on call - quiet, as expected for my team, but was still apprehensive, given it being Black Friday week 😅
- Had a nice day coworking with Carol on Monday in town
- The crashing on my mobile Firefox Nightly has resumed - I'd gotten down to ~20 tabs, and through the week the tabs increased until I had my first crash at 53 tabs. But now - from some of the discourse over the last few days - I've put the pieces together that maybe this is since the new React rollout at GitHub, as it appears that the crashing only seems to happen when I'm replying to things on GitHub 🤔
- One evening I couldn't see Morph in his spot in the kitchen but then when we walked into the living room, he was on his tower 🥰 He'd snuck in, and then happily stayed there most of the evening
- Rolled out Open Policy Agent support for dependency-management-data, followed up with linting via `regal` 👏 Very happy with what this will unlock, as well as a slightly better model for managing more complex policies (as a stronger form of dependency monitoring than advisories)
- This afternoon I had a _spectacular_ game of TitanFall2, getting ~250 points in Attrition, which was then followed up with a private game of Frontier Defence - my first time - which was Master difficulty 🫣 But managed to do it twice 👏🏼
- Cookie's been pretty good this weekend - still sleepy from a day at daycare on Friday
  - This morning she let me have a good lie-in, until she started barking at her reflection 😅
  - This evening, however, she's making it known she's got energy and annoyance to spare 😅
- Got access to Mend's SCA platform, and started work on making it possible to take the data the platform exposes and use it with dependency-management-data - this will be my first foray into trying to sell proprietary software 👀
- Not sure if I found a mosquito in my office, or just something that looked like one, but very odd for this time of year
- Was an interesting OpenUK meetup

- TitanFall2
- Super Mario Odyssey

Watched:
