- Had a nice Tuesday evening at Canal House with Tulio, Tushar, Danillo and Lewis, catching up after many years, and nice to see everyone
  - Was cool to hear my blog posts are still solving problems for the org 🤓
- Morph came in the living room for a bit on Saturday night while Cookie had a chew, which was nice, but didn't really get much cuddles
- A last-minute three day weekend as my parents were going to come up on Friday, but then didn't get a chance to as the weather was pretty naff. Had a good catch up on the phone instead
- Thinking of setting up my NAS again - largely after listening to [_The beginning of the end of physical media_](https://changelog.com/friends/16) - and because there's a few programmes that I can't watch easily any more, but that I've ripped from DVDs
- Announced the [upcoming v2 release for oapi-codegen](https://github.com/deepmap/oapi-codegen/discussions/1309), and finalised the code changes - looking forward to having it live, and getting a blog post out about some of the things we've done to reduce the sprawl of the dependencies
- Making steps towards a 4 day week, with my day off being for Open Source 👀🤑
- Worked on an interesting piece of work looking at vCluster and how we can use it to reduce the number of EKS clusters we're using
- Got Chapati Junction for the first time in _ages_ and it was very good 😋
- Had a good call with OpsLevel to demo their platform for incident management, and to get an idea of what I'd need to do to integrate DMD into it
- Almost applied to YCombinator - for no reason other than seeing someone post about it being the deadline that day. I say almost, I _considered it_ and didn't because I couldn't be arsed to even look at the application form, let alone spend precious executive function on it
- But I did make some good progress on some work towards setting up the infrastructure for dependency-management-data at work
- Had a couple of post-surgery checkups for Cookie, and she got the all clear from the vets
  - But she's had to have her ring on today to stop her from licking too much where she had surgery 😅
- Feeling much better about my talk at TechMids this coming Friday
  - Listened to my article version of the talk on a walk on Saturday as a way to refresh the content in my head and work out what's needing updates, which fortunately didn't need too much changing, just a few things adding for what I've shipped since then 👏🏼
  - Made a couple of tweaks to the accompanying blog post, and need to make a couple of tweaks to the slides and do some run-throughs but looking forward to it
- Had a contribution to one of my (much smaller) projects as part of Hacktoberfest, which was very unexpected!
- We've put the heating on for the first time this autumn, it's been very chilly this weekend
- Saw OpenSauced's app went live so set up [my user account](https://app.opensauced.pizza/user/jamietanna) and played around with a few dashboards for oapi-codegen
- Had a nice post during the week about my talk at DDD
- Got approval to post [my on-call compensation](/on-call-compensation/) so glad to have that live, and it got cross-posted to Hacker News but didn't do very well (which is fair, it's not that spicy)
- Been a bit out-of-sync with our Goustos this week with me not around on Tuesday, and then having Chapati Junction for our Friday night (which was Thursday)
- Didn't finish Wordle on Tuesday 😭 My first missed game in &gt; 400 days!
- Had a bit of a catch-up with Gareth, and looking forward for another one this coming week
- Unions came up a lot this week with folks I was talking to 👀
- Lost internet on Wednesday during my only meeting of the day 😅 Very annoying but luckily wasn't back too long after
- Hit 9999+ articles in my Wallabag "to read" list 🫠
- Blogumented [`renovate-graph` and Renovate's `local` platform](https://www.jvt.me/posts/2023/10/13/renovate-graph-local/), which ended up flagging a couple of issues, and was a bit slow to write as I ended up choosing a rather large repo to test with 😅 Also was a bit overwhelmed trying to post it, but also wanting the bug reports raised upstream too
- Went for a Sunday Roast today at The Railway, Lowdham 😋
- Morph's food arrived and as I was filling up his container with it, he was meowing at the door of the conservatory to be let in 😹
- Spent some time looking at how to get the version of the Go compiler used by a given binary blogumented, and spent some time doing the same for Rust, but it looks like there's no way to check with Rust, at least without digging into `.debug_info`

Played:

- _Apex Legends_ as usual
  - Had a tonne of frustrating crashes with _Apex_ yesterday
- _Bowser's Fury_, completing the story mode and then done a bit of the extra stars, but not bothered about getting 100% as I've already done that before

Watched:

- _Loki_
- _Beckham_
- _Scrubs_
- _Futurama_
- _One Piece_
  - Binged it 🫣
- _Kim's Convenience_
  - As we wanted another nice programme like _Schitt's Creek_ 🥰
- _Game Changers_ (on YouTube)
