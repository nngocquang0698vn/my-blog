My first of three weeks off between Deliveroo and Elastic:


- Had a good talk at DevOpsNotts about [dependency-management-data](https://dmd.tanna.dev)
  - Got some good questions and interest
  - Definitely one o
  - Was glad to get my corresponding blog posts out about it, too, as they're a good point-in-time view about what dependency-management-data is and **??**
  - Lemmy and some folks on Hacker News found it interesting, but it didn't quite go viral (it was a bit of a long read, tbh)
  - Raised a lot of features/bugs on dependency-management-data

- After a couple of very busy days prepping the talk (including finishing my slides not 10 minutes before I left for the event 😅🙈) which was a follow-on from being busy trying to get my "bucket list" of things done before I left Deliveroo, I was finally able to take a breath and relax a bit into this time off

- Cookie's been a bit under the weather this week - started with her **??** on Monday, and then later in the week **??**
  - She's **??**

- Anna away for the night **??** - Cookie was good
  - Cookie slept nestled up against me all night 🥺🥰


- Hacked around with the Zoho Mail API, as I find that setting up email aliases is always so awkward, so it's pretty cool that I now have a few CLI commands I can issue to get a new alias added, much more easily, but it wasn't exactly the easiest process to get up and running 😅
- Lost my eyemask so significantly it couldn't be found for a couple of days (despite searching _all over_ the house) but it ended up being two pillowcases deep
- Years of going to the Showcase have spoiled us, and the seats at the Cineworld in town pale in comparison, but it was still very fun watching Barbie, and thoroughly enjoyed it
  - Was very thankful to have a super cool new pink Elastic t-shirt to take out 💅
  - Cookie didn't have a great time with us going out, and took a while to settle down after we got home, including requiring us cutting her pig's ear in half so she'd eat it instead of burying it behind a cushion
- Had a lovely date night at Dino, with some good food and **??**
  - Didn't realise it was Notts Pride until we arrived in town to a lovely show of happy folks 🏳️
- Although I was excited to try the Magnum Double Starchaser ice creams, I was very disappointed

- Made a start on setting up AWS Lambda into [endoflife.date](https://endoflife.date)
- Lost ~12 hours of analytics this morning as Caddy needed restarting
- Finally destroyed my Kubernetes cluster - after ~3 years of running it for my Java side projects - ahead of a pending patch being applied this coming week
  - As I was setting around to porting the final application from Kubernetes to Fly.io, I found that I'd already done it a couple of months ago, so have been spending ~$12/mo unnecessarily for a couple of months and should've just deleted it at the time
