- A chilled start to the week with the bank holiday weekend
- Cleaned up the spiders on one of the garage doors ahead of Thom coming to drop off some bits from the house
- Did some cleanup in the front garden afterwards
- Shipped a new release for oapi-codegen, and started putting some bits together for the next one
- Smart meter installation was partially successful - unfortunately we've got to get National Grid (tomorrow) in to sort out our dodgy earth connection(?)
- Accidentally had Cookie have two walks on Thursday morning 😅
- Been having some thoughts - but nothing concrete or put in action - around how to monetise dependency-management-data long-term, if I end up going that route
- Been feeling the pain of no real-time Renovate for my personal projects on GitLab and spun up Renovate On Prem on Fly.io
- Cookie's been barking a fair bit in evenings - including some in the day - which has been a bit trying of our patience
- Sitting in Anna's office on her chair, Cookie felt left out - as she's been loving sitting on it herself - and jumped up onto my lap 🥰
- Updated my [_How to Undo a `git push --force`_](https://www.jvt.me/posts/2021/10/23/undo-force-push/) after finding a new way to unpick it after accidentally overwriting a new oapi-codegen repo (not yet used in production!)
- Had a weird match of Control in _Apex Legends_ (will share photos tomorrow) where the map mostly didn't render, which was a little disconcerting to play with, but also meant I could see enemies through walls 😅
- Had a fun glitch with Cat Snack Bar where, after finishing the last event level, I had a _load_ of money carried over, instead of it being reset, so managed to mostly complete the next level 😹
- Had a lovely walk around Colwick park earlier with Carol and Juno
  - As expected, there was a little bit of chaos from the dogs
  - Had a very good vegan sausage and special egg sandwich 😋
  - Got some nice dog ice cream
  - And Cookie's been so sleepy since 🥰
- Looking at organising a trip to DevonDogs in the new year for a Cookie-safe holiday with a side of fun dog training!
- Cookie launched at Anna this morning but slipped a little and rolled into a cuddle between us 🥰
- Almost finished my slides for DevOpsDays 👏

Watched:

- _Parks and Recreation_
