- Cory
  - When we got home, I saw there was an incident - unrelated to my team, but that I was pretty sure I knew what the issue was - and managed to help fix it, which was pretty nice!

- Found it very weird this weekend with so few folks filling up the _Apex Legends_ games, and having to wait **??** quite some time for games
- Was very chuffed to have been offered a free ticket to go to Lead Dev
  - Anna's been considering going for years, and this year she got about to convince her work to let her go
  -
- Spent some time this week
  - Played with both kin-openapi and then converted it to libopenapi which was good to see the differences and give me some confidence in being able to do the migration between the two for oapi-codegen
  - Was also quite nice to get back to the problem as last time I'd tried to solve it, I'd done it from JSON Schema, but for an incredibly similar approach, but with a slightly less complex set of schemas, as well as learning more about Sorbet
- Got back into oapi-codegen world
  - Did some issue triaging and working out what low hanging fruit we wanted to merge before the next release, which we've now done - first in a while **sweat**
  - Looking ahead with Marcin
  - Playing around with libopenapi instead of kin-openapi, so we can start to support 3.1
- Started the _Cat Snack Bar_ event late - as I hadn't decided if I was going to pay money to resume my status from last time - and they gave me a free resume, which was nice and presumably because I joined it later than usual. Will have managed to finish this level by the end tomorrow

- Cookie wednesday awufl
Cookie land shark
- Cookie's been not super great this week - she's become a bit of a land shark in evenings, and for a large part of Wednesday was just barking _non stop_ for hours at us. We're not sure why, or what could be the problem, having tried many things, but are so thankful that finally she settled down

- Had a chilled Bank Holiday Monday
  - While Anna was out, I tried somewhere new for lunch - Locked n Loaded fries - which was good, and my first time eating wings in quite some time, but glad I got them and happy with a bit of an "out there" choice

- Tried making a Nutella milkshake which was very sweet but good
- Got our usual Asda pizzas which was so good üòã
- Had a really chilled weekend which has been nice

- Got into town on Saturday
  - Went to The Bag Shop (**TODO**) and found a new backpack üëè As the colour I wanted wasn't available, I've ordered it online alongside a couple of other choices so looking forward to getting them

- Walk around forest

- Got a battery-powered compressed air gun, instead of using the cans, and it's made quick work of my dusty desktop inside, and my super gross keyboards

- Starling joint accounts now support **??**

- Public speaking:
  - Had it confirmed I'll be speaking at DDD East Midlands, more details to come soon **:eyes:**
  - Submitted a talk to GitHub Universe so **:crossed:**
