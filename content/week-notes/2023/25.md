A pretty toasty week, but with nice periods of rain interspersed to make it not as toasty

- Had to have some lemon sorbet at lunch on Monday to cool down ðŸ¥µ
- Presented an interesting postmortem at work around Postgres `ORDER BY`s that was the culmination of some good learnings recently
- Had a good session to discuss dependency-management-data's internal data-updating service and get some more folks aware of exactly how it works
- On Friday our end-of-year bonuses (that had been pushed back by 'roo) were paid, which was nice
- Been watching Blind where a lot of discussion's been happening this week, with some folks handing in their notice, but not aware of any in my team, or teams I work with regularly
- ~Project "Rubber Band" is coming along well, and hopefully will be in a place to talk about soon~ I'm excited to say that I'm going to be [joining Elastic](https://www.jvt.me/posts/2023/06/26/joining-elastic/) in August ðŸŽ‰
- Excited for tomorrow to head back to London to LeadDev which starts on Tuesday. Was very appreciative of getting a free ticket from the conference, and I'm definitely going to be sharing my thoughts and lessons learned after it!
- Accidentally had a very large mug of Phish Food, remembering just how sweet it can be, but also how much I love it ðŸ˜‹
- Got to Costco to pick up a few bits - including some frozen Korean Fried Chicken that I'm very much looking forward to trying - and excited for the future of us having fairly easy access to bulk tasty things ðŸ˜‹
- Had a nice lie in on Saturday, after it being a very early start on Friday
- Nice to have Sarah and the kids come for lunch, and Cookie was very well behaved, and a reminder of how far we've come
- With Cat getting Bo in a couple of weeks, we've been reminiscing looking at photos/videos of Cookie and remembering how truly chaotic and loud our lives used to be ðŸ˜…
- Was nice to be at Ravi's engagement party, and get a chance to see a lot of the family I've not seen since pre-COVID
- Was nice to see my family, and have some time to catch up with Cat
- Due to some issues with the trains at Bedford today, it was a bit of a wait at St Pancras for the train home, as all the train were messed up, so I had to queue for half of the length of St Pancras to get my train back to Nottingham, but luckily got onto a train in an hour, and I'm actually going to be home sooner than planned
- Woke up at one point in the night to Luna standing on my chest, but she must've noticed I was stirring as she jumped off ðŸ¥º
- My old ASUS 4K monitor (that I got in my last year at uni, so getting old) has finally packed in, after a few weeks of only rendering 1080p on Linux, and not working on Windows for about a year (but assumed that's just Windows being crap) so with my bonus I'll be getting a shiny new Dell Ultrasharp and moving my current one to secondary position
- In dependency-management-data world:
  - After last week's ability to perform cross-table `JOIN`s, I set about starting to set up the `report advisories` command to perform more consolidated queries, which has led to me writing some _chonky_ queries with `CASE` statements and providing a much more reasonable report on the way out
  - This has also led to being able to output CSV reports, which can then be shared over i.e. Google Sheets, reducing the need to have everyone using it have CLI access
  - Hit a couple of bugs with sqlc as part of this, so will look to see if they're things I can contribute fixes towards, but at least they're reported upstream for now
- For most of the week I've had [IOU](https://open.spotify.com/track/05fPNUOJ5ZwhNBavMU7vIu?si=8ff3f6d30b6545d4) on a loop, and this weekend I discovered [BANG BANG! (My Neurodivergent Anthem)](https://open.spotify.com/track/7tEV3l3E7YM4tNkBe6UiVY?si=5443a1b5cf504ffc)
