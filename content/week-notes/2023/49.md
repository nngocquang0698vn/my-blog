- Got the smart meter finally installed 👏 Been fun keeping an eye on the usage over the last few days
- As many other people on GitHub, I got spammed by an invite to the "advent of Vim" organisation, and several related notifications
- In the public speaking world:
  - I'm on the waitlist to FOSS Backstage 🤞
- Been on the Call for Papers panel for the Open Source and Open Source Software track at State of Open Con, so been doing my first CfP review this week
  - it's required a fair bit of mental energy to make it through the ~145(!!) proposals, of which there have been some really great talks
  - I'm thinking of writing up a post for how I've found it as a process, especially as someone coming from it with focus issues
- Had a nice chat with Hannah
- We had an early Christmas with Anna's family, as we're spending actual Christmas with my family
  - Cookie was unfortunately not as chill as she could've been 😬 Took a lot of mental energy looking after her, and we definitely could've done better with her but it's hard trying to cook, host, and see family on top of managing her. But bless her, she did better than she could've
  - Did a 12 person Celebration Crown of Turkey & Duck roast, but with 8 peoples' food of trimmings, which was good 😋
    - It went much better than last year, as we'd picked up more baking trays the night before at Sainsburys, was a bit more aware of the size and temperature of the oven, and made space in the kitchen for the various bits of prep and placing of hot things after they'd cooked, and I had a headphone of chill music to keep my cool
  - Enjoyed Prosecco, hot chocolate with Lidl's Irish Cream and it feeling like Christmas
  - Very appreciative of my secret Santa fulfilling my wishlist and buying 10 Toblerones 😹😋
  - Cookie's had such a sleepy afternoon and has been so cute 🥰
- And this afternoon we had a chilled decompression time playing with Lego, and listening to _Off Menu_. I finally got through some custom Brickheadz that I got a couple of Christmases ago, but it needed a lot of sorting through pieces to work out which ones are missing

In dependency-management-data world:

- Shipped GraphQL support, which was a long time coming, and I'm pretty impressed with how it's ended up
  - Was quite interesting working with gqlgen, and learning how GraphQL implementations can actually work on the server-side, as I've only ever done it from the client-side
  - Using my Stimara helped with focus, but as I've found with previous times, that I can still picture in my mind doing my Stimara when i.e. trying to get to sleep

- TitanFall2
  - Had a really good game of Frontier Defence that we were doing so well, got to the last round, but then a server disconnect dropped me out and I couldn't rejoin 😭
- Several mobile games, as a another way to kill time on my phone that's not consuming content

Watched:

- _Friends_
- _The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 2_
- _The Witcher_
- _Reacher_
  - Caught up on season 1, ahead of season 2 this coming week
- _Game Changers_ (on YouTube)
