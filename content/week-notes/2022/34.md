The week with a fully functioning journal! Been nice being able to store my private thoughts somewhere, moreso because it's given me a project to sink my teeth into and sort out some of the prep work before I move my site to a dynamic site, too. It's definitely been taking a lot of my spare time to sort it out, but it's been worth it for the benefits, and means I don't need to add awkward vague things in here.

- Had a nice catch up with Tushar in town on Thursday, which was nice to see him, share some gossip, and generally catch up, as it's been a while!
- Took a longer long weekend, with Friday off as well
  - The plan was to tire Cookie out then go in town for a bit of shopping, but ended up only Anna going in, and me looking after the ðŸ‘¹
  - Started the day off at Rushcliffe park, and had a good run around and time in the agility training
  - Had our first pub lunch out (at [Broad Oak](https://www.greeneking-pubs.co.uk/pubs/nottinghamshire/broad-oak/)) together since getting Cookie, which was fairly chill despite other dogs being outside
  - While we were waiting for food, a couple of horses came down the street, and Cookie did not like it ðŸ™ƒ Previous times she's seen them she's been a little inquisitive, but this time she was clearly spooked and unhappy with them being around, so lots of barking. Then didn't help that the owners _came to the pub_ and sat a couple of tables away with their horses. Cookie wasn't too bad, fortunately, but bit more of a stressful lunch than hoped
  - With all that excitement, we decided that Anna would go in, and I'd stick with Cookie. If Cookie was chill I could head in, but then we decided I'd just stay with her
  - Had a shandy ðŸ˜‹
  - We had a lovely day of it - although not quite everything we wanted to do, it was still nice to have, and it was a big step from our lack of outings up until now
- Dave and Faye came to stay, so we could all see Anna's Dad for his birthday, which was nice
  - Cookie got a bit guard-dog-y in the night, hearing one of our guests moving in the night and howling at them ðŸ˜¬ Not what you want to wake up to at 4am!
  - Had a good Sunday roast today, and Cookie did surprisingly well at their house - the second house visit she's ever had outside of ours! - despite some barking, and trying to jump in the pond
- After _many_ years of using the Wallabag Android app, I finally discovered that I can turn on dark mode ðŸ˜…
- At work, it's been an Operational Excellence sprint, so spent a couple of days getting our first backlog of work ready, then started on some low hanging fruit - didn't quite get it all sorted before the long weekend, but happy with the bits I did around DataDog DB monitoring - saving a good deal of money yearly, as well as giving us better insight into our DBs
- Cookie's been not as good on her own ðŸ˜¬ couple of barking incidents while we've been out of the house - once to Sherwood - and once to just go to the shops. Going to be going back to trying to build her up to us being absent and comfortable with it
- Cookie's been presenting her belly for belly rubs this week, which is an amazing development, and I'm very happy that she likes it and appears to be asking for it - I'm reinforcing it and making sure that is what she wants, too
- Chris got Geoffrey, and I'm very much enjoying the lovely pupdates ðŸ˜»
