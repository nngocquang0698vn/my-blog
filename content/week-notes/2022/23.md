New desk, and on-site in London!

- Got my new Jarvis Fully, and will post photos when it's all finished, but it's _very_ close to having my desk very nicely cable managed and set up properly for the first time
- Cookie got her wobbler stuck under the drinks cabinet and came over and barked at me to come rescue it for her ðŸ¥º
- It was the Deliveroo quarterly on-site in London
  - Had a very good few days of good food, good company, and a lot of socialising!
  - Had a lot of lovely folks say hi over my website t-shirt, and had some nice compliments
  - Did a lot of thinking about what we've done so far, and thinking ahead to the future
  - Got some discussions about OpenAPI, and definitely got a name for myself as a big fan ðŸ˜…
  - Got a blog post draft written for the Roo blog on the train, hopefully it'll be up soon ðŸ‘€
    - Did it as a talk to Care and Trust (Crust), so will be nice to be able to share it further!
  - Lovely to see the whole team, have a lot of social opportunities, and time to hang
  - Had an exciting evening on Wednesday with being taken out for a surprise dinner at Bierschenke
  - Had a good boat trip along the Thames as our planned Thursday social, and then out to New Young Cheng for dinner
- Cookie's been much better this week
  - She's been pretty cute, sleeping with our legs as pillows, or sleeping between the two of us looking at us ðŸ¥º
  - Had 1-1 dog training on Monday which went well, and gave us a load more confidence in what we're doing, and leaving Cookie alone a bit more to show her it's OK. Done some more crate training, and she's really much more chill this week. Spent a lot of time on her own and **??**
- Had Saturday breakfast with Cookie, Carol, and Juno which was really nice - they had a good play, we had a good catchup, and then while trying to eat the two of them played under the picnic table ðŸ™ˆ
- Started work on a JSON to OpenAPI converter
- Hit 20k clicks from Google in 28 days, my best stat so far
- Cookie may have hayfever ðŸ¥º We're giving her antihistamines and she's getting better, but we need to try and keep her out of long grass just to make sure it is that
