New desk, and on-site in London!

- Got my new Jarvis Fully, and will post photos when it's all finished, but it's _very_ close to having my desk very nicely cable managed and set up properly for the first time
- Cookie got her wobbler stuck under the drinks cabinet and came over and barked at me to come rescue it for her ðŸ¥º
- It was the Deliveroo quarterly on-site in London
  - Had a very good few days of good food, good company, and a lot of socialising!
  - Had a lot of lovely folks say hi over my website t-shirt, and had some nice compliments
  - Did a lot of thinking about what we've done so far, and thinking ahead to the future
  - Got some discussions about OpenAPI, and definitely got a name for myself as a big fan ðŸ˜…
  - Got a blog post draft written for the Roo blog on the train, hopefully it'll be up soon ðŸ‘€
    - Did it as a talk to Care and Trust (Crust), so will be nice to be able to share it further!
  - Lovely to see the whole team, have a lot of social opportunities, and time to hang
  - Had an exciting evening on Wednesday with being taken out for a surprise dinner at Bierschenke
  - Had a good boat trip along the Thames as our planned Thursday social, and then out to New Young Cheng for dinner
  - Hotel was a fair bit away as London was booked up - which we presume was for the Jubilee - so did a fair bit of walking while I was there
  - Had the most excitable welcome home from Cookie which was super cute, and amazing to think what it'd be like if it was longer than three days I was away for
  - Headed back earlier than planned on Friday - as I was knackered from less sleep, lots of physical and mental exercise and socialising - which was good as it gave Anna a chance to go out for dinner with Carol
- Cookie's been much better this week
  - She's been pretty cute, sleeping with our legs as pillows, or sleeping between the two of us looking at us ðŸ¥º
  - Had 1-1 dog training on Monday which went well, and gave us a load more confidence in what we're doing, and leaving Cookie alone a bit more to show her it's OK. Done some more crate training, and she's really much more chill this week. Spent a lot of time on her own and **??**
  - Still had a bit of an annoying time with her though, she ain't perfect
- Had Saturday breakfast with Cookie, Carol, and Juno which was really nice - they had a good play, we had a good catchup, and then while trying to eat the two of them played under the picnic table ðŸ™ˆ
- Had a picnic in Wollaton Park with Emma and Andrew and Flora which was really nice!
- Started work on a JSON to OpenAPI converter
- Hit 20k clicks from Google in 28 days, my best stat so far
- Cookie may have hayfever ðŸ¥º We're giving her antihistamines and she's getting better, but we need to try and keep her out of long grass just to make sure it is that
- Had my first Mr Whippy style ice cream in ages ðŸ˜‹
- Got the new living room lamp, which is super bright, so we'll be getting a Hue for it, but looks nice
- Been chatting with a soon-to-be-colleague about Roo, IndieWeb and much more which has been nice!
- Yet again thinking of shuffling around my site to get things faster, as a ~7 minute turnaround time for each change is really painful, but I know I need to do a lot of rework to get to instant syndication
- Had a couple of long walks with Cookie early in the week which was nice, and on Tuesday I took my headphones for the first time
- With Chapati Junction closed on Saturday, we tried out Seoul Chikin which was very good and a nice change
- Had my first issue raised by one of my ex-colleagues for one of the libraries I own, which we resolved pretty quickly

  - Gutted it's finished ðŸ˜ž
