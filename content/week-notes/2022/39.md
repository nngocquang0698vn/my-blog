- Spent some time at work migrating an internal tool to a GitHub App, from just using the APIs with a shared user's credentials, which was a good experience
- Claire and Tom's wedding, which was really nice, and special to be part of their day
  - Picked up my new suit, which looks really great, and I feel very cool in it
  - Cookie did well with Anna's parents for the day, and it was nice to see her when we came home
- In the run up to Hacktoberfest, I finished off my dependency analysis at work, and got the blog post out about how I'd done it, and hoping that it'll help with narrowing down some contributions
- Cookie's been much more cuddly and sleepy recently which is nice. But she's also still being somewhat annoying at times - Friday while Anna was out I didn't have the best time ðŸ˜…
- Spent some time looking at running Go HTTP apps in AWS Lambda more easily, wrote a library for it, then discovered AWS had their own. Woops! But looks like I can give them the gift of a blog post using it, to boost SEO
- Had a chill day today post wedding
  - Despite not taking Cookie for a walk this morning - as we both needed a bit more rest and was very surprised that Cookie spent most of the day asleep, and not getting annoying until her usual 1600
- Not done anything on Hacktoberfest yet ðŸ˜± But I've got a day off tomorrow so I'll be able to get at least a couple of my planned PRs in tomorrow
- Worn my Crocs outside a couple of times this week - this is apparently how it starts ðŸ™Š
- Got around to setting up my recommendations site's infrastructure, but not yet written much on it while I work out how best to format the metadata to get it working with common Micropub editors, and then thinking that maybe I need to make my editor more generic and able to use it with any Micropub endpoint
- Been really enjoying playing Gun Run in _Apex Legends_ as a fun quick game
- Played some _Black Mesa_ on my Steamdeck, and dang, FPS on consoles are hard ðŸ˜¬
- Feeling a bit under the weather post-London for work, and so very nervous that I had Covid (ahead of the , but fortunately many days of testing proved I've just got low tolerance for the common cold
- Ordered new dining room table and bed, after thinking about both for a while
- Heating is now on, which seems early but better than being ðŸ¥¶
- Got some cuddles from Morph this morning with breakfast, which was very nice until Cookie came in, who was very chill and they both coexisted for a minute or so, then Morph left
