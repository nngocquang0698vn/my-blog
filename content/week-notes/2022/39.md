- Spent some time at work migrating an internal tool to a GitHub App, from just using the APIs with a shared user's credentials, which was a good experience
- Claire and Tom's wedding, which was really nice, and special to be part of their day
  - Picked up my new suit, which looks really great, and I feel very cool in it
  - Cookie did well with Anna's parents for the day, and it was nice to see her when we came home
- In the run up to Hacktoberfest, I finished off my dependency analysis at work, and got the blog post out about how I'd done it, and hoping that it'll help with narrowing down some contributions
- Cookie's been much more cuddly and sleepy recently which is nice. But she's also still being somewhat annoying at times - Friday while Anna was out I didn't have the best time ðŸ˜…
- Spent some time looking at running Go HTTP apps in AWS Lambda more easily, wrote a library for it, then discovered AWS had their own. Woops! But looks like I can give them the gift of a blog post using it, to boost SEO
- Had a chill day today post wedding
  - Despite not taking Cookie for a walk this morning - as we both needed a bit more rest and was very surprised that Cookie spent most of the day asleep, and not getting annoying until her usual 1600
- Not done anything on Hacktoberfest yet ðŸ˜± But I've got a day off tomorrow so I'll be able to get at least a couple of my planned PRs in tomorrow
- Worn my Crocs outside a couple of times this week - this is apparently how it starts ðŸ™Š
