The one with the Oodies, the not-delivery of the cooker, and Cookie's first night away from us ðŸ™€

- Started the week contorted in bed, with me face down, but my legs facing upwards, which of itself was fine right, cause I could've moved, right? No, Cookie was curled up between my legs, and I didn't want to move her ðŸ¥º
-

Oodies
- not Will Shu

- Had a couple of surprisingly good days solo with Cookie (in my office), although Tuesday afternoon Cookie was being really quiet, which is _always_ a bad sign - turns out she had started chewing on one of my flip flops ðŸ˜  Luckily she was OK, I'm not sure exactly how much she'd ingested vs just spat out, but bit worried, and of course rather annoyed once I knew she was OK
- Had some brainpower spare, and made some good progress with dealing with anonymous objects with oapi-codegen - something raised very early on when I started playing around with it, and I finally got around to investing more time in, and then fixing, the issue. Hoping to have it live this coming week!

- Had hoped to go to the cinema on Friday - on a day off - but due to puppycare not being available until Saturday, just had a bit of a chill day at home, a trip to Ikea, and putting some bits up around the house
- <span style="display: none">Pushed the limit of my credit card ðŸ’³ with an update to my wardrobe - got some great things, and some much needed fancy new shoes</span>
- With _Lucifer_ now finished, we wanted to find a next programme to watch, and have been enjoying _Andor_, albeit after a slow start, after prompting from lots of good feedback on Twitter over the weeks
- Thinking of putting some talks forward to FOSDEM, which if they're chosen, should give enough time to actually write them ðŸ¤ž
- Found one of my Croc giblets in the garage while doing the bins, which is funny because I didn't even realise one was missing ðŸ˜…
- With my Pixel Watch still with notifications on vibrate + loud, I've muted a few noisy chats, and been thinking about unsubscribing to some emails I barely check, but am noticing much more
- Had some poor success with clipping Cookie's nails this week - caught it a couple of times where she tried pulling away as we clipped it, hurting her (a little), causing her to yelp out of surprise, and then making it harder to clip them. With them being especially long, we've needed to, but ended up going back to the dremmel and that's made some progress, albeit much slower
- Been doing a bit more crate training with Cookie to try and give us a bit more safety with her having a safe space to be contained while we're not around, as she broke through the barriers in front of the front door while we were in Ikea
- Morph's been getting more attention this week - in particularly when Cookie was away overnight, which was very nice ðŸ˜» - but also didn't make it helpful at times when he kept jumping onto the dining room table and trying to get food/affection while Cookie's been in her crate, thus stressing her out _even_ more, so he got a few nudges away, but didn't take the hint
- Anna brought Morph up for Sunday morning cuddles in bed, as we didn't have Cookie to cuddle, which was nice, and all three of us enjoyed having him with us ðŸ˜»
