The week we applied to get a doggo!

- After deciding that _soon_ we'd start looking at getting a dog, we decided this week to put in the application to Paws2Rescue
  - We've fallen in love with quite a few dogs, and having to narrow them down has been difficult
  - The application took some time to do, but after a few days of constantly checking emails, we got the email to say we'd be a good fit this afternoon!
  - _But_ was absolutely gutting to find out that our favourites [Wabi](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?vanity=Paws2Rescuedogsforadoption&set=a.301064861930401), [Lessie](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.316502897053264&type=3) and [Zina](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.316959217007632&type=3) are all (in the process of being) adopted ðŸ˜­
  - Spent a bit more time looking through Facebook and finding other cuties that'd fit with Morph, and sent off a reply this evening
- May have bought some more creme eggs, as they were on offer ðŸ™ˆ
- After lots of LinkedIn hits on my articles, I've started to auto-syndicate posts to Twitter, via Bridgy, as it's more likely that folks following me on Twitter care about my posts than they do on LinkedIn
- Got a lovely Hawkins & Brimble gift set from Anna, which I'm looking forward to using and looking after myself a bit more
- Been playing around with Spring Boot projects, putting a few things in practice that I've recently been doing which is good
- A quieter week at work, doing bits and pieces between federated model work
- Lots of evenings finishing off the wallpaper stripping
- Not feeling the best towards the end of the week and needed the weekend to recover, but still not quite feeling amazing!
- A good PHPMiNDS about OpenAPI contract testing
- New season of Apex has been fun so far - playing lots of Control
- Had a lovely Friday lunch out with Carol, and nice to have a bit more chance to spend with Juno, too
