- It was Cookie's first birthday ðŸ¥°
  - Carol came over and we had a fairly nice dinner, although Cookie wasn't super chill
- We've got a tonne more time with Morph this week, and I think he's rediscovered how nice truffling is,
  - He's been in the living room quite a bit,
  - Yesterday we thought he'd gone into the conservatory, then heard some slight munching sounds and realised he was sitting on the table eating Cookie's biscuits ðŸ˜… she was watching him and not complaining so ðŸ¤·
  - While Cookie was at day care on Friday, Morph and I spent a good chunk of the afternoon on the sofa while I did some work
  - We've even had both of them on the sofa together - with Morph purring and flopping, and actually not being too bothered by her, although when she got a bit rambunctious he left - but then came back later
- Haven't played Nflxdle the last couple of days as we now need to sign in to play, which is a bit disappointing
- Cookie's been a bit bad at howling at the door when people are coming to it
- Spent a precious chunk of No Meeting Wednesday on the phone to Dell support to chase why my replacement monitor (first requested 88 days ago) had suddenly been cancelled - managed to get it resent and I've set it installed over the weekend, and hoping that I no longer have graphical distortion with my Mac
- Morph's eating got better towards the middle of the week - even when I gave him a plate of chicken! - but definitely better now
- GitLab runner minutes escalated to a much more painful time, as the self-hosted runners I had, both on Kubernetes or on a fresh VPS ended up with, ended up being far too slow to actually build my site ðŸ˜¬ Not great. After fighting it for most of a day between work, I ended up moving a couple of projects to a new group on GitLab - need to finish off the migration, but the main thing was my site was unblocked, because that day was when I was front page of Hacker News and /r/programming
- To give my cluster some capacity, I scaled down my notifications and google-fit Java services, and hacked together a good-enough Go service for what I need
- Friday Lunch at work, for some Five Guys and a Reece's Peanut Butter Cup milkshake ðŸ˜‹
- Made the new bed this afternoon, which is very cool, but classic DIY it took a little bit longer to do
- Cookie spent tonight barking through dinner - after barking through us making the bed - because she wanted to get at a sliver of chicken that fell under the oven while we were cooking ðŸ™„
- Ordered the new range cooker - with fancy induction hob, and some new pots and pans. Going to take a few weeks to get here, but very excited
- Joined Anna for the Saturday morning walk with Cookie which was nice
