- Made some good progress with making `renovate-graph` easier to run, and learning some more about how I want to consume the data, too
  - Also found why `npx` was failing - I'd not actually been packaging the built files in `dist`, so anyone consuming the npm package where clearly not working, which explains a lot about me trying to use it, too ðŸ˜…

- Been bitten by my phone not counting towards my FitBit step count - even when I don't have my watch on - so lost a few steps this week
- Cookie **??**

- Pretty busy work week ?
- The new cooker has been very frustrating **??**, and I'm really frustrated that the installation and delivery company used by John Lewis didn't do their due diligence when checking it could be installed. Luckily got an electrician on Monday to come and have a look, and then by the time I got through to John Lewis to book redelivery, the supplier had closed. Waiting days for the supplier to get in touch - but never doing so - I chased John Lewis, and finally got told that unless I wanted to cancel and re-order it (with the risk that a) 5 weeks turnaround time may be necessary and b) it doesn't appear to be in stock any more) I couldn't get installation. Very ðŸ¤¬ and making this a not very fun??
