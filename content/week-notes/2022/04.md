The double glazing is in! House is warmer, although it has been warmer, so can't solely take the credit for it

- With the end of the windows being double glazed, it's been a bit of a loud week, and harder to concentrate - even if people on calls haven't been able to hear, so been able to be doing less pairing than hoped
- Was really nice getting Morph back and having him being so chill and cuddly. Really hoping that he keeps this up for a bit
- Finally went to _Naughty but Nice_, the sandwich and tasty treats cafe down the road, and it's been really good, and we've enjoyed a few lunches there, which helped because we hadn't been able to get into the kitchen a few days while they were doing the kitchen/dining room windows
  - Already had 64 people look at the photo of the menu I added to Google Maps which is cool
- Been doing a bit more investigation of different software architectures, with jMolecules' Layered and Onion architectures, and reading a fair bit of different views on various things, which has been nice because it's never really been an active consideration in the past
- Been giving the terminal emulator [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/) a go, and been enjoying it so far, especially with easy pasting from the primary clipboard, and how responsive it is, as well as a lot of great features like theme support and emoji input!
- First step on a few things this week - one which is a slow burn for self care, and the other which although may be a slow burn, I'm very much looking forward to a quick win too!
- Got (everything but Week Notes) publishing to LinkedIn, which may be useful, but maybe longer term it's going to be too much noise for my feed. I've already seen a fair few hits, and wonder if I should get articles syndicating to Twitter, too as people following me there are likely more interested in my thoughts
- Sorted out my Renovate setup on GitLab - requiring the `renovate.json` - but managed to make some progress on burning down the list of dependency updates
  - Thinking I may start moving my example projects into their own group on GitLab, so I can also set up easier Renovate onboarding / settings
- Spotted that my autognerating GitHub README hasn't been working, because [I'd not got the branch correct](https://github.com/jamietanna/jamietanna/commit/d6e1a0c364fa0236ea7c64237fd8d624e4b7a044)
- Had the weekend off from actively doing home bits, but made some decisions about future house tweaks
- Been nice being able to watch TV while washing up, in our current temporary layout
- Didn't get a chance to do my hair this week but hopefully will get it cut this coming week
- Listened to a lot of the very chill [Ben BÃ¶hmer & Rob Moose - Erase (An Apparition) feat. lau.ra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AeKrv6oPuR4)
- Correlation IDs work has led to [creating a library for it](/posts/2022/01/30/spring-content-negotiator/)
