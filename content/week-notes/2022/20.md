Struggling to think what's happened this week ðŸ¤”

- A couple of days off work with a bad cold and cough
  - Was good to not push myself back to work, especially as there are interesting things going on at the moment and I don't want to miss them
  - Really not enjoying being ill, but glad it's not COVID ðŸ˜·
- A really productive end to the week though, and feeling pretty happy with my place in the team and providing value
- Lots of working on OpenAPI this week:
  - Enjoying the ease of server generation with oapi-codegen, and the speed that the maintainers have been picking up things I've reported!
  - Did an impromptu team session on OpenAPI, to make sure everyone's at a similar level of understanding
  - Built a library for Go testing
- Had a very chill Saturday on the sofa, watching the very good Netflix series _The Lincoln Lawyer_
- Had a super lovely time in the park with Carol and Juno, and having a good run around, play, and general cotch
- Also had a nice dinner with Gousto plant-based lentil enchiladas, which was nice ðŸ˜‹
- Cookie's been a bit of a ðŸ¦¨ this weekend
- Cookie's been settling a little bit better, but still not amazingly, so we've got a crate to do some crate training
- Had our first Chapati Junction since Ramadan began, which was very good
- Cookie's had a couple of times getting caught in things - one time getting her ears slightly caught in the fence in the conservatory, and once chewing of the drawers and getting her teeth caught ðŸ¥º Poor baby, she seemed OK but a little spooked both times
- A bit of a mixed bag at training
  - Got taught a trick for calming Cookie down which felt really violent - although it wasn't - which was holding her collar tight (not cutting off breathing!) and face her away from us through our legs, which did help, but when she was struggling and not settling when she did it, and she looked up at us like "why are you letting the trainer do it to us" ðŸ¥ºðŸ¥º
  - There was a baby chick running around and spent a while carrying it and trying to get it away from the dogs, but it kept coming back
