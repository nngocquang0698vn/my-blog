Struggling to think what's happened this week ðŸ¤”

- A couple of days off work with a bad cold and cough
  - Was good to not push myself back to work, especially as there are interesting things going on at the moment and I don't want to miss them
  - Really not enjoying being ill, but glad it's not COVID ðŸ˜·
- A really productive end to the week though, and feeling pretty happy with my place in the team and providing value
- Lots of working on OpenAPI this week:
  - Enjoying the ease of server generation with oapi-codegen, and the speed that the maintainers have been picking up things I've reported!
  - Did an impromptu team session on OpenAPI, to make sure everyone's at a similar level of understanding
  - Built a library for Go testing
- Had a very chill Saturday on the sofa, watching the very good Netflix series _The Lincoln Lawyer_
- Had a super lovely time in the park with Carol and Juno, and having a good run around, play, and general cotch
- Cookie's been a bit of a ðŸ¦¨ this weekend
- Cookie's been settling a little bit better, but still not amazingly, so we've got a crate to do some crate training

Watched:

- _Yes Minister_
- _Human Resources_
- _The Lincoln Lawyer_
- _The Wrong Missy_
- _Star Trek: Deep Space 9_
- _After Life_
- _Below Deck Mediterranean_
- _Kim's Convenience_
