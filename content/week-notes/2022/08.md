The week I (somewhat) jokingly call Crunch Week, because:

- The aftermath of Storm Eunice and losing what felt like half of the fence
  - Managed to **??**
  - Got someone booked in to do the fence tomorrow, which is very good given how busy they all are with **??**. Bit pricey, but **??**.
  - Was a bit more flexible working **??**
- Our (virtual) home visit ahead of adopting little pupper Ella
  - There was bit of anxiety ahead of it, not knowing just how much we may need to do, or **??**
  - We got some bits on Monday evening **??** but ended up **??**
- Decorators coming to do the living room
  - There's been a tonne of dust everywhere that several cleans hasn't quite picked up, **??**
  - The living room is looking _really good_ and we're very excited for it all being complete

- Some bad nights sleep, thinking about everything going on at the moment

- With the home visit going well, we started on
  -

- Decorators

- Saturday wire hedge
  - After noticing the bins have some old food stuck **??** (ðŸ˜¬) a few weeks ago, this week I managed to pressure wash it clean
  - Was a lot of fun having my first pressure washer!
- Added support for listen posts on this site, so I have a specific way to capture i.e. podcasts
- Playing around with a bit more Go
- Had some good conversations about architecture
- Bit of a brainworm one day this week **??** to try and get it working, but managed to [find a way to **??**](/posts/2022/02/01/vim-replace-with-command-execution/)
- Spa day!!
  - Booked ages ago
  - **??**
  - All the rooms
  - Napped in the slumber room
  - Had some very nice mango sorbet and dairy-free mint chocolate ice cream
- Not enjoying the old style COVID tests, and finding that they're making testing much harder to be motivated to do, although we still are
- Morph has been sitting on the beanbag chair of his own accord
- Anna got me a new fidget cube, which I've been using a fair bit during all the calls this week
- Light switch in the bedroom snapped, but fortunately not one we use that much, so it's not as much of a problem
- Got my [Manual of Me](/posts/2022/02/23/manual-of-me/) finished, which I was happy about and have had some good responses to it so far
- One of the Gousto's this week we had oven-cooked rice, and I accidentally forgot to put water in it, so it ended up being **??**
- Doubled up the sauce for the Gousto Satay Pork Rice with Pickled Cucumber & Radish Salad, and found it even better than usual!
- Had a bit more fun with classless.css, migrating over my applications where possible, removing Bootstrap / default browser styles
- Morph was super confused when I said hello to him through his cat flap - him in the conservatory, and me outside - and although not distressed by it, his little face and meows were so confused
- Morph's been very cute this week
- Because there's not enough stress in the world already, the Russia has decided to invade the Ukraine

Watched:

- _Zak George's Dog Revolution_
- _Wanderlust_
- _Love is Blind_
  - Ended up getting to episode ~8 and looking up the finale results, so we could skip through some of the not-as-fun couples
- _Inventing Anna_
