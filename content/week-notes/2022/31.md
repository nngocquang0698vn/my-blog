- Cookie's been fairly troublesome this week, being a bit barky, bitey and at times really not enjoying being on her own, but has been making up for it with some incredible cuteness
- Cookie's first time at her new daycare, which went well and she seemed to have had a great first half day
- Lost another charger to Cookie's nibbling ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜©
- Spoke about OpenAPI at Deliveroo's Summer Tech Talks, which was cool - shame to not be in person and get a chance to chat to folks further, but got some good questions and hopefully gave some good insight
  - Was also awesome to get some stickers from the OpenAPI Foundation
- Made a pretty good Ken Hom style stir fry this evening
- Been hyperfocusing on content-negotiation this week, finishing off my Go library, then solving issues in the Java library - so hopefully the folks I know using it will have a stronger base to work from - and then releasing the test cases as external things
- Been enjoying some extravagant puddings with M&M crispies on top of Ben & Jerrys ðŸ˜‹
- Focussing on more foundational and stability issues at work is leading to some good fundamental platform understanding which is good
- Had a nice Sunday brunch with Carol - albeit Cookie made us especially late - and then I had a somewhat stressful walk home with her - a mix of her knowing Anna was walking away from us, and I felt like her harness was tearing (although it wasn't! Maybe it was just tightening?)
- Got Cookie's claws trimmed, which was a stressful experience for all involved, and we needed to get one of them later that evening when she was sleepy, but fortunately she's now in a much better place
- Had Anna's Uncle Chris' 70th which was nice, and good to see some of her family I've not met before
- Didn't have Dave and Faye to stay as they'd had a close COVID call ðŸ˜¬
- After dropping Cookie off at daycare on Saturday, I remembered that I'd left the iron on and panicked a little bit ðŸ˜¬ fortunately it was fine, but not good to have left the house for, like, half an hour with it on ðŸ˜¬ But it's all good cause I turned it off after use, right... Right??? Nope, turns out I left it on for over 24 hours ðŸ˜± So glad to have not burned down the house, cause that wouldn't have helped how I've been doing this week ðŸ˜¹
- I can see my next hyperfocus be HTTP client caching (in Go) as a cost/environment saving thing, and I've got a long list of things to read/watch to prepare for starting
- Cookie's getting really good at _wait_ when I come back from the shops/etc and letting me bend down to say hi before launching at me, but isn't as good with anyone else ðŸ˜…
- Went over to Lidl on the way back from getting Cookie's nails done and getting petrol, which she did not understand or enjoy, as Anna looked like she was just leaving me there
    - Bought a couple more tubs of mango sorbet and some of the lemon sorbet to try, so it's all good
- Tried Anna's Pixel Buds Pro for an Asda trip, which were pretty good, and although I'm not 100% sure if they're what I want, I may borrow them a bit to test drive them as an alternate option for work/life
- Lidl's got some really great Hoisin sauce on offer ðŸ˜‹
- Tried my first Burg - with Anna out for the day - and found it to be pretty good, but a better milkshake (Kinder Bueno) than burger
- Had Monday off work as I was feeling a bit run down from Saturday onwards, and whereas Anna managed to feel well enough to get back to work, I thought it would be best to take a day. Had some chill time with Cookie, did a bit of laptop/desktop and PC and switch gaming. Was feeling a bit better, so back to work on Tuesday to do pretty much the same thing ðŸ˜€
