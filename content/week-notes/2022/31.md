- Cookie's been fairly troublesome this week, being a bit barky, bitey and at times really not enjoying being on her own, but has been making up for it with some incredible cuteness
- Cookie's first time at her new daycare, which went well and she seemed to have had a great first half day
- Lost another charger to Cookie's nibbling ðŸ˜ ðŸ˜©
- Spoke about OpenAPI at Deliveroo's Summer Tech Talks, which was cool - shame to not be in person and get a chance to chat to folks further, but got some good questions and hopefully gave some good insight
  - Was also awesome to get some stickers from the OpenAPI Foundation
- Made a pretty good Ken Hom style stir fry this evening
- Been hyperfocusing on content-negotiation this week, finishing off my Go library, then solving issues in the Java library - so hopefully the folks I know using it will have a stronger base to work from - and then releasing the test cases as external things
- Been enjoying some extravagant puddings with M&M crispies on top of Ben & Jerrys ðŸ˜‹
- Focussing on more foundational and stability issues at work is leading to some good fundamental platform understanding which is good
- Had a nice Sunday brunch with Carol - albeit Cookie made us especially late - and then I had a somewhat stressful walk home with her - a mix of her knowing Anna was walking away from us, and I felt like her harness was tearing (although it wasn't! Maybe it was just tightening?)
- Got Cookie's claws trimmed, which was a stressful experience for all involved, and we needed to get one of them later that evening when she was sleepy, but fortunately she's now in a much better place
- Had Anna's Uncle Chris' 70th which was nice, and good to see some of her family I've not met before
- Didn't have Dave and Faye to stay as they'd had a close COVID call ðŸ˜¬
- After dropping Cookie off at daycare on Saturday, I remembered that I'd left the iron on and panicked a little bit ðŸ˜¬ fortunately it was fine, but not good to have left the house for, like, half an hour with it on ðŸ˜¬ But it's all good cause I turned it off after use, right... Right??? Nope, turns out I left it on for over 24 hours ðŸ˜± So glad to have not burned down the house, cause that wouldn't have helped how I've been doing this week ðŸ˜¹
- I can see my next hyperfocus be HTTP client caching (in Go) as a cost/environment saving thing, and I've got a long list of things to read/watch to prepare for starting
