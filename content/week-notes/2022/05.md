An unsuccessful week of getting our deliveries:

- Our first week with Gousto not arriving which meant fending for ourselves
  - Very frustrating that it happened the day we had a shopping order arrive, so if we'd have known we'd at least have been able to get things
  - Didn't arrive the next day as expected either, but we at least got the refund
  - Played around with making my own spicy peanut sauce, with inspiration from a Gousto from last week, which turned out well
- Had a Deliveroo order which went way past the "the latest time we'll deliver is", and the driver was literally around the corner then drove across town 😬
  - Got a full refund, which helped offset being 🦀 and having sideways pizza
- Lidl's Creme Eggs offer made me instead find a better deal with a 48 pack 😅
- The water tank has started its periodic refilling, which is fun cause I thought that was fixed 😬
- Did a lot of wallpaper stripping
  - Listened to a fair few podcasts, too which was good
- Managed to get my dotfiles finally off a branch and merged into `main`
- Stormy Saturday night was a little disturbing and a little bit concerning as the conservatory is very loud when the wind blows
- Finally got a chance to get a haircut, and started the updating of my photo across various platforms
- Got a mix of the Ikea bits, but got some of it coming tomorrow
- Made some good progress with the bedroom reshuffle, and it's looking much better now!
- Didn't attend HWC in the end as there was a lot to do at home
- Although there's still much to do before it's possible - like fixing up the fence - we've decided 🐶🐶 we're getting a doggo 🐶🐶
- Spent a few days this week trying to track down a project that did client-side, offline file upload and serving which I swore I'd seen before
  - Was hoping to build a client-side OpenAPI viewer i.e. using Elements, as I've now seen it
- Morph has spent a lot of the week sliding down the sofa
- Feeling like we need a dependency graph for some of the living room work, with the ballooning of it all
- Been playing around with the Starling API
- Morph's got very yeowly a couple of nights, and has been rather annoying, but has eventually come to settle
- Made peanut butter bread, which was yum!
