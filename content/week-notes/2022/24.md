- Monday off work for our first full day without Cookie, so we could go and see Dr Strange!
  - Nice to get away, do something a bit "normal" again. The film wasn't quite what we thought it was going to be but was generally good
  - Had a cheeky Nandos ðŸ˜‹
  - Cookie had a great day at daycare
- We had some incredibly warm days this week, so had the fans out, the windows open overnight, and some kibble-filled ice cubes for Cookie and Morph to cool down with
- Got props in the Friday Tech Huddle which was cool - I'd had a couple of folks mention how much I'm smashing it since I started just two months ago, and it's awesome to have a Deliveroo-wide note to appreciate it! ðŸ’ª
- Cookie came over to me - on the sofa - and plopped her chew in my hand to ask me to hold it for her ðŸ¥º
- Cookie's wagging her tail a bit more when she's happy - when she's giving me kisses, or this evening when she had a very good chew
- Cookie enjoyed licking my sweaty feet, which is a bit gross but also cute!
- Got some good internal reviews of my OpenAPI blog post for the Deliveroo site, hopefully should be up this week once I've made some edits
- Lots more code at work, working through towards a deadline this coming week, and bringing OpenAPI support to the service we're integrating with so it's much easier to get going. Caught some integration issues with Stoplight Prism, too, as the OpenAPI spec wasn't quite right for the data we were sending!
- Our first session of the new puppy training class which was good - very nice to be nearer and able to walk - albeit it was quite warm on the way - and a bit more of a chance to socialise and see the other dogs. Was also nice to have Carol, Juno and Thom there, and Cookie won the "musical sits" (musical chairs, but when the music stops the dogs need to respond to a sit command, and the last dog gets eliminated from the competition) which was very good
- Morph also appears to have a bit of hayfever this week, and today has been sneezing tonnes of stuff everywhere ðŸ¥º
- Had Anna's parents round for father's day, and had another cheeky Nandos
- After years of it being recommended, started _Stranger Things_ and have been binging hard this week and really enjoying it, albeit it's a bit tense/horror-y at times for what we're used to
- One morning Morph came in and it looked like he had something on his back - about half an hour later we found out it's likely due to a new [spittlebug concern](https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/uk-world-news/looks-like-someone-spat-plants-7199491), so have been sending in reports for the bits we've found in the garden ðŸ˜³
