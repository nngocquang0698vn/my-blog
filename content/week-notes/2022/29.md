To sum it up - ðŸ¥±ðŸ¥µ

- The hottest days in history in the UK ðŸ¥µðŸ¥µðŸ¥µ
  - Lots of fans cranked up high, curtains closed and ice in water jugs
  - We've been giving Morph and Cookie frozen kibble which has helped keep them cooler and a little more hydrated
  - Morph spent Monday upstairs in the loft room - the second hottest room aside from the conservatory - like the little idiot he is, but seemed OK and happy.
  - Not a lot of sleep because of the intense heat, and then suddenly being _super_ cold after that, meaning we needed to re-add the duvet
- Morph joined me for standup one day and had a bit of a cuddle on camera, then stood on the edge of my desk swiping/trying to nom my face, which must've been distracting but fun to watch ðŸ˜…
- Eaten a lot of mango sorbet to cool down
- Replaced my work laptop - with the spare that hadn't yet gone back - after it stopped charging last Friday, so been doing a bit of re-setting up which fortunately wasn't very time-consuming!
- Morph's spent a bit more time in the living room
  - It's helped that while we're eating Cookie's not been in with us, which has also helped her be more chill with not always being around us
  - This morning, Anna had Morph and Cookie on the footstool, coexisting very nicely ðŸ«¶  they're getting closer to being BFFs!
- Saw Neeshu and Anubhav on Thursday, which was really nice
- Had a lovely Sunday lunch with Carol, with super yummy huevos rancheros, and some mostly chilled Cookie and Juno time. It was Cookie's first time to someone else's house, and she did surprisingly well, and allowed us to have a nice leisurely lunch
- Played some more _Rogue Legacy_
- Got another shout out in the Tech Huddle, for some incident management pieces, which was cool - that's twice now in my probation period ðŸ’ª
- Cookie's been doing much better recently, and when the weather has been cooler, we've done a few walks. Increasingly seeing great progress, and she's being very cute ðŸ¥°
