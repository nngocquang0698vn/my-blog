A week of leftovers **??**

Boxing day:

- forgot freezer
- Got some good gifts from my secret Santa, and my receipient seemed happy too
- Morph was a bit cheeky trying to eat Christmas cake / from Austin's highchair

New Year's Eve:

- Watched _Bullet Train_
- **??** Spice
- Fire

Otherwise:

- Sorted out my blogroll's webmentions being sent - as it turns out static pages don't appear in my Hugo sitemap - and **??**
- Also got Fedifinder updated to work with my mastodon account string, so now folks can discover me through that, as well as making it more discoverable on my site

- Smacked the Internet box on the side of the house while taking the bins out - barefoot - in a frantic rush before they got to our house, which fortunately was in time, as well as not having caused our Internet to be cut off ðŸ˜…

- Made some more progress on my Chef blog post, and hoping to get it mostly done tomorrow, so I can be done before the new year begins!
- Considered rebuilding my Renovate + `endoflife.date` checking code this week as an Open Source thing, but haven't gotten around to it. Will look to see if it's worth Open Sourcing what I've done at work, or if rebuilding it from scratch as a fresh project, is better

- Cookie got the big bone a few times this week
- Started playing ranked on _Apex Legends_ to give myself some time to play the Broken Moon map, because I'm really quite bored of Olympus/World's Edge

- Kinda wished I'd done a "2022 in Review" post, but didn't have the energy nor the time to dedicate to it, at least in the level of detail I used to do ðŸ˜…

- Family ?
  - Tesla
  - Cookie was incredibly shocked by Cat wearing my Oodie, and couldn't quite work out what was going on ðŸ˜¹
- Cookie isn't a fan of Irish Cream - the smell on my breath / the glass makes her back away, bless

- We'd pulled forwards Gousto (with a 5 meal box, for the first time) from this coming Tuesday/Wednesday to Thursday, so we could eat some meals over the weekend, rather than needing to source our own food, or so we thought ðŸ˜… Turns out we did not cancel the other box, so got another 4 meals delivered yesterday, meaning we've gone for several weeks of cooking for pretty much ever meal ðŸ˜¬ I know that's a normal thing that real human adults do, but not us ðŸ˜¹
- Got some "motion detected" notifications in the Garage, but couldn't see what it was so dismissed it. A couple of days later we went into the garage and spotted the cause - Morph. It turns out he'd spotted that his new dry food was in the original packaging on top of the drawers, and _needed_ to knock it over and have a very thorough attempt to chew through the hardened plastic ðŸ˜¹ He didn't make any progress, but it looked pretty knackered! As a reward, I let him lick all the crumbs from the inside which looked very funny, where he was 80% inside the bag licking it all up
