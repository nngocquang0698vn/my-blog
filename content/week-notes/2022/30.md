A nicer week weather wise, although a mix of rain and being fairly warm.

- Finally got to visit the new daycare for Cookie which went well, and hoping to have her in at the end of this coming week for a trial half-day
- Got the old sofa collected, so now there's a bit more room in the garage
- Mum and Dad came to stay on the way back from holiday which was nice
  - Started, and finished, the wooden puzzle I got earlier in the year, which was fun and difficult
- Ended up absolutely shattered and exhausted on Saturday night, and spent a lot of Sunday shattered, so tomorrow morning we're going to do COVID tests ðŸ˜¬
- Playing a fair bit of _Rogue Legacy_
- Been starting my implementation on a content-negotiation library for Go, and finding it a bit awkward to need to write so much of the underlying code, as the standard library's media types don't quite support the level of functionality we need to have
- Had some good cuddles with Morph this week, both in the living room and the conservatory
- Slipped down the final stair when coming down the stairs one night - annoyingly as Hue didn't trigger - and have got a pretty bruised toe and foot, which has made walking a little bit awkward
- Written a good chunk of my "learning Go" blog post, but didn't quite get around to finishing it off
- Had Cookie on the other side of the barrier in the living room to reduce being a bit naughty, and it's been working and she's been much more comfortable being on her own throughout the day, too
- Missed Wordle, Quordle, Moviedle and Posterdle yesterday ðŸ˜­
- In a fun state of affairs, may end up implementing the CDDO Federated API Model at Deliveroo ðŸ¤“ But may get a chance to feed back some thoughts for what we're going to be doing for additional functionality, and loading in of data
- A fairly busy week at work between a few projects

Watched:

- _Uncoupled_
- _The Circle_
- _God's Favourite Idiot_
- _Star Trek: Deep Space 9_
