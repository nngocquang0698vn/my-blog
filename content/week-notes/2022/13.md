Our first full week with little Cookie, who's summed up entirely with ðŸ¤—ðŸ˜œðŸ‘¹, and kinda wishing I had done Day Notes instead of Week Notes!

- Lots of house management, podcasts
- Lots of napping and TV

- Managed a couple of days (**inc today**) with no accidents inside

- Vet, chicken box

- Nomming on things
- Saturday
  - Walk
  - Wanted to wean her off being in our room, so put her crate outside the bedroom, and gave her the chance to not be locked in overnight, to which she ended up sleeping between the two of us - was a surprise that we slept the best we had done all week when she was literally on the bed and any movement actually would've **??** but **??**
  - Slept with us, as we **??**
- Sunday
  - Nervous on stairs, took a while to get her down
