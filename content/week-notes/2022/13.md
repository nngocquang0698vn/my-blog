Our first full week with little Cookie, who's summed up entirely with ðŸ¤—ðŸ˜œðŸ‘¹, and kinda wishing I had done Day Notes instead of Week Notes!

- First and foremost, it's been a _very_ difficult week - she's been a handful, there's been a lot of frustration (with housetraining, finding that she's got separation anxiety mostly from Anna) but it's also been very rewarding with how cuddly and affectionate she is
- Anna's been doing a stellar job with training, and refreshing training with snippets of Zak George where needed. It's amazing how much Cookie has already learned - just hours after learning `leave it`, I was able to tell Cookie to do it!
- It's been rather loud through the week as we wean her off us always being around with her, and she's been anxious with being in her play pen or on her own, but it's been getting better, and today she's barely noticed when we're out of the room
- Been doing a lot of podcast listening - as they're easier to dip in and out of compared to articles with text-to-speech - while doing a bit more of the chores around the house
- Spent a lot of time with Cookie on the sofa, with her sleeping to my side, and me on my laptop / watching TV. Been very nice to have another pet who's cuddly and sleepy
- Cookie loves giving kisses, so I've been trying to teach her that `kisses` means give us/people kisses, and have also been using a slobbery sound as an alternative, that's working nicely
- It's been very cute watching Cookie get comfortable in places, moving pillows, growling and doing in-place parkour to shift the blanket into the shape she wants, or being a bit flopsy
- Cooked a couple of chickens - as high currency rewards - and after shredding it for her was a bit slow and sub-par, I found that using the food processor to give us a nice ground chicken works really well for treats
- Managed a couple of days with no accidents inside, which is good, and we've been learning a bit more about what her different anxiety crying means, rewarding her with time out of the play pen, instead of leaving her in there, as well as learning the hard way that if in doubt, take her out for the loo!
- Morph and Cookie have slowly got closer through the week, with a noticeable amount of progress. We've been managing the environment as best as we can to make it better
- Giving Morph the kitchen has meant we've been getting a bit more fit by vaulting over the pet gate, which has been a great lower-body workout!
- Been very cute having such a lovely welcome in the morning when I come downstairs, and this morning she even jumped into bed when Anna got up with her, and slobbery kissed me awake ðŸ¥°
- Cookie's been teething, and it's been fun and weird finding a few teeth after play sessions, but also has been a lot of misdirecting her mouth to toys that we want her to nom, instead of us!
- Since Cookie and Morph have been getting on better - but by no means actually friends - we've opened up the conservatory, and then reshuffled Morph's barriers so he can have some space from here, so she can tell us when she needs to go out, rather than us needing to take her out. We've learned through the week that Morph being around, and them not getting on, has really added stress to going out, with them passing by each other, then Morph coming out while Cookie is outside, and even if not adding to her stress levels, definitely to ours
- Updated my architect-backed MF2 pipes to include an HTML view of the data, as content-negotiation is a pain, and it means it's an easier human-readable interaction
- Created tiktok-mf2.tanna.dev, which in the end isn't as useful as I'd hoped due to the media being time-limited, and the videos not being usable
- Earlier in the week, Cookie's done some very annoying voms - unlike Morph, who gives a good minute of warning cause he's retching so much, Cookie doesn't even burp, it just comes up ðŸ¤®
- Put the new rug out, and Cookie went absolutely wild, doing parkour all over the living room. Incredibly hyped up, wondering if maybe she got a little high off the fumes, or just overexcited generally?
  - We did talk about the rug - that Hilary recommended we get for the new colour scheme - being ruined, and that it potentially would anyway with Morph, so why not just put it down now, especially as Cookie wasn't really enjoying hardwood floor. Turns out within an hour or so we'd had an accident, and over the next few days we've had lots of food dropped in it, too. S'all good, as it looks nice, she's enjoying it
- To avoid manual work for reauthenticating my `micropub` command, I set up the `micropub auth reauth` subcommand, which was a good chance to play with Go's OAuth2 client and HTTP server for a single-use authorization code flow and token exchange
- Got my phone case, which has made a massive difference, and meant I'm much more comfortable using it, holding it and resting it places too
- Cookie met her first people aside from us - Anna's parents - and although she got a bit more excited and distracted than we'd hope, it was nice to know she was OK with people. She did get a bit resource guardy around a new toy - a food-filled bone - but we've worked on it and it appears to have been mostly about her having it around new people
- Hoping to have my contract finalised in the next couple of days ðŸ˜…
- Been keeping an eye on the Facebook group for other Paws2Rescue folks, seeing that a lot of people went straight to treats, walks, etc, whereas we were a bit more reserved, and eased Cookie into things. Also saw some new parents with more difficult situations than ours, so puts things into perspective!

More updates tomorrow...
