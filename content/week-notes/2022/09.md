The one with all the waiting ðŸ‘€

- The job hunt - that you won't have been aware of because it's not been appearing in week notes until today, where I'm backfilling it - has come to an end ðŸ‘€
  - Ended up getting 2/3 of the jobs I'd gone for. Bit gutted to not have the third, but really happy with the two choices, and **??**
  - Should be announcing it in the next few days
  - Handed in my notice, and starting to **??**
  - Was funny it came after a comment about me looking for another role internally **??**
  - Really found it difficult just waiting for companies to get back in touch, especially after their timelines to get back weren't followed up on, and the "what if"s playing in my head
  - Having the conversation with my manager hanging over me has also been difficult, knowing it's still quite early on for me to be leaving, for me to still have a lot that we'd want to do, and to be leaving the team in the not-best place
- Also in waiting, we've been waiting for things to come back about Ella, and with the work on the garden taking a bit longer to be done, we're a little apprehensive of the time delay for her being ready to come over
- Some very bad nights' sleep
- The fence has been done! Been a long time coming, and especially to help prepare for Ella,  **??**
- ikea
- waiting for doggo
-
- Wifi reset
- Go
- Notice
- Started on - but not quite finished - replacing `jwks-ical` with an Architect version, `rsvp-calendar`
- Morph's been very playful this week, which has been very cute, and a couple of nights, he's sat on the chair next to me and had a bit of a play with my hand - although I've not always escaped the scratches
- Been writing a bit more Go, to create a CLI for Micropub
- At work, it's been a busy few days since handing in my notice, realising I have ~12 days left to work, so we want to make sure we can get as much done:
  - Had a bit of a pain doing error handling for the federated model's `WebClient`, but managed to get around it
- Re-org at work has been mostly announced, and aside from me leaving, it's been pretty unsettled
  - Had a comment about me handing in my notice not being the biggest thing to happen on a given day!

- Changed the plug sockets in the living room, and so far the house hasn't burned down ðŸ§¯
- Finally sorted the Ethernet in Anna's office wall, after a bit of a "oh crap" moment when I realised I'd cut it too short (after we'd carved a good deal of the wall out for it to be fit in) and wouldn't be able to fit the box, then realised we could slowly pull more cable from outside in, giving us room and it's now very nicely tucked away
- My Discover Weekly playlist hasn't been great this week, so it's been listening a lot to my Liked Songs, which has a good mix of all sorts of music from the last decade - but mostly the last few years, and it's reminded me of some really great music
- I'm officially a committer on Wiremock, and we'll soon have me as an official maintainer - very excited to be able to help continue the work on a great project!
