- Lots of OpenAPI + Go, pairing and getting stuck into new service at work
- New sofa!
  - Spent a good chunk of Saturday clearing out the garage and making room for them to bring the new sofa through, and put the old sofa after, until it's collected
- Sorted out my awkward autocomplete issue in Neovim
- Kaspa's
- Asda pizza!!
