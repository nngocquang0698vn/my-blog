A warm week, and giving Cookie some more time on her own

- It's been another hot week
  - Not _quite_ as hot the other week, but still early 30s
  - Lots of fans, ice in drinks and mango sorbet
- Down to London for the weekend to celebrate Mum's birthday
  - I headed up earlier on Friday to avoid train strikes, and got to Miller and Carter for dinner ðŸ˜‹ was our first meal out as a family since March 2020, and was very nice
  - Had some good food - mint chocolate cheesecake, Dishoom's chicken biryani, some home-made nachos, and a great steak to name a few
  - Got to see all the cool changes at the bungalow
  - Surprisingly got a nice hello from Luna
- Haven't actually written any code for HTTP caching, but I've been doing some research into it and that I'll need to write a library for the new RFC 9111 standard
- Was nice to have some train journeys to just sit down and blog/tinker away at things
- Cookie was home alone on Thursday while we went to Sherwood to pick up a few things
  - Picked up some nommy stuff from Nibbles in Sherwood while we were there
  - Saw Dylan and had a bit of a catchup
- Came around time for my next therapy, and a _lot_ to catch up on
- Went into town to measure up for a tailored suit ðŸ˜±
  - lots and lots of choices to make, but managed to get there in the end, and excited to see what the result will be
  - Also led to a good three hours of Cookie being on her own, which was mostly OK
- May be able to get Linux at work ðŸ‘€
- Installed the Linux jigsaw game `palapeli` for a bit of something over the weekend, which was quite useful, as well as on the train home
- Had a lovely welcome from Cookie when I got home ðŸ¥°
