A very cuddly week with both Cookie and Morph - individually.

- Started the week off with Cookie being super snuggly in bed in the morning, and being a very nice way to wake up ðŸ¥°
- Cookie's been especially snuggly this week, lying on our legs and cuddling more, which is nice
- Walk on Monday was cut short as fireworks for Diwali started
- While Anna and Cookie were out for a walk on Wednesday, I had a good set of cuddles with Morph on the sofa ðŸ¥°
- On Thursday morning, with Cookie in daycare, Morph came exploring and was very loudly meowing/screaming at me and Anna ðŸ˜… Was nice to have him upstairs and exploring, as pre-Cookie he wouldn't be allowed
- Had a nice Saturday off from Cookie as she went to Anna's parents for the day
  - Started off with sofa time with Morph which was nice
  - Bought a couple of new coats to refresh my wardrobe, which look pretty great
  - Had a yum lunch out at Street Food Club with food from Banquet 1415 and shared a cocktail
  - Cookie had a mostly good day without us, although a little bit hyper / loud at times
- Cookie finally got to the middle of one of her antlers and has been able to get the gooey insides
- Finished off the bedroom, after some lunch times spent doing bits of touch ups
- Had a lunchtime walk with Cookie, as the weather was pretty awful in the morning and wouldn't have been a fun walk for Anna and Cookie, and was nice to have a bit more of a relaxed lunch, although the park was a lot busier than expected
- Morph's been particularly meowy and needy this week too, which has been cute and it's been nice to get some more time with him
- Had a successful attempt to clip Cookie's nails after many months of being on the dremel, and thinking we may start back with the clippers, as the dremel takes so long
- With the _Apex Legends_ season coming to an end I've had a bit of a panicked week trying to at least get to level 100 before the new season - which I did today - but unfortunately not thinking I'll be able to get to 110 before Tuesday ðŸ˜¬
- Played a lot of _Rogue Legacy 2_ and especially enjoying the Halloween update with the enemies wearing masks, and lots of pumpkins around
