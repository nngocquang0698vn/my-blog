- The cold of winter is starting to bite, and ü•∂ not looking forward to it. Very glad the windows got upgraded to double glazing in January, and we've only had the heating on today. We've been shutting the conservatory door to keep the house warmer, but means Morph is a little bit more isolated than usual üòû
- Made our second fire with the new log burner - the previous use when we got it in January - which ended up not being super perfect as we didn't have enough kindling, but was still nice and warm
- Bought an axe and had some fun chopping some of the woodshed's wood, which was quite fun. Managed to mostly destroy the tree stump I've been using to cut on üòÖ
- After the success of the roast ham over the weekend, I did another one on Monday
- My new suit looks _really_ good at the fitting and looking forward to seeing it when it's been finished
- Got the new washing machine! Super quiet, nothing smells of mildew coming out of it, and looking forward to see what impact it has on our bills, with how efficient it is
  - Didn't think that using the IoT side of things and connecting the app to it would be a good idea, but ended up it being quite a positive change and getting a push notification to say it's finished is cool
- Managed to get out of the house for almost 2 hours to do some shopping, which was really nice, and although she got a bit howly by the time we were getting ready to leave, but she coped really well and managed to settle herself, between bits of barking while we were out
- Had Anna's parents round for the afternoon to get Cookie further used to them in our home, and made a roast chicken with all the trimmings, which was good, and made for a good leftovers dinner tonight
- Saturday morning I managed to get a good amount of time to cuddle with Morph, while Cookie sat outside on the deck
- Last night Cookie spent a lot of the evening sleeping with my foot as a pillow üòç
- Morph joined us in the living room for breakfast on Monday while Cookie had breakfast which was a good experience and nice to have some cuddles in there with him, but Cookie didn't enjoy it once she'd stopped eating
- Got new eyemasks, which are good and seem to be making a good difference, as well as being much comfier and very good at blocking light out
- Got a new fidget cube, which is nice and weighted, and looks pretty cool too
- Got a filling for one of my particularly bad teeth - one that's been many years on-and-off feeling a bit sensitive, and very much knowing I needed to get it looked at - which apparently could've been root canal level in ~6 months if left unchecked, so glad I finally got the spoons to be able to go get it seen to. Didn't hurt, and was funny and weird to have a slightly numb face for a bit after
- Made some good progress with designing the bedroom, with thanks to Anna's design skills
