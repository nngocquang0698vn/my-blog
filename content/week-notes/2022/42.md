- A pretty busy week
- While on a walk with Cookie earlier in the week, we surprised a couple of squirrels chilling in a driveway, and one of them ran basically into Cookie as it was trying to get away, making her and me jump ðŸ˜…
- Although I've not yet finished it enough to blog about, I've put out a new Micropub editor, `editor.tanna.dev`, which I'm very excited to be able to wind down my existing editor
- Happy to get a few blog posts out this week
- Fixed an issue with my autogenerating README, that must not have been working for a couple of weeks on GitLab ðŸ˜…
- Most of the way through writing a hacky CLI to convert JSON schema (be it standalone or part of OpenAPI) to the Sorbet type checking annotations for Ruby, as it's something I'm doing a fair bit, and it's fairly easily automatable
- Nice weekend at my parents' - was quite chilled, nice to see everyone and had some good food
- While I was away Anna made some great progress with painting the bedroom
- With all the rain this week, we've not let Cookie into bed after going for her night time wee, which she did well with until 5am when she barked at us to be let into bed, cause that's her usual time to get up on bed with us ðŸ¥º
- Cookie full on licked Morph's face this week ðŸ˜¹
- Cookie and Morph have been doing very well this week, and we've got both of them in the living room together, with Morph plopping in my lap while next to me
- Yesterday morning Cookie decided that ripping hair off my toes was a fun pastime ðŸ™ƒ
- Got the new Steam Deck Dock, but unfortunately my Switch controllers aren't ideal, so the 2 minutes of playing _Stray_ is enough until I source a more appropriate controller
