- Was privileged to speak at work's Women in Tech Monthly alongside some awesome engineers about Hacktoberfest
- Hacktoberfest has begun, and I've managed to get my first 4 contributions in, luckily, so I'm feeling less of the pressure, but the tracker didn't work for a while as it wouldn't (yet) handle the SSO for work being declined, so only just started appearing on my profile
- Watched a lot of _Dynasty_
- Uncle Mike's funeral on Friday
  - Went to the Ruddington Arms afterwards for the wake, was nice to catch up with people, and had a super duper tasty buffet
- Had Mum and Dad stay till Saturday afternoon, and got some more time to catch up, and be with Cookie
  - Went to Broxtowe Park for a walk with Cookie, then Broad Oak for lunch, which was mostly OK, although Cookie wasn't perfect, we managed to eat a nice pie and have a drink
- Cookie's spent yesterday afternoon and almost all of today napping ðŸ¥°
- GitLab's been telling me for months about getting my Open Source projects updated given [the changes to user limits](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2022/03/24/efficient-free-tier/), but executive dysfunction, and I've ended up burning through all my minutes in my 2000 minutes' allowance in 6 days ðŸ˜¬ paid $10 for another 1000, and burned through that by midday today. Luckily I've got some space on my Kubernetes cluster to have some self-hosted runners running to save money
- Played a lot of _Rogue Legacy 2_ this weekend
- Bit disappointed in _Apex Legends_' Shadow Royale mode after the great fun of Gun Run, so been playing a bit less this week
- Officially "out" with my ADHD, and it's been nice to hear from people who've felt similar and wanted to chat a bit more about it. I'm hoping to get my "how I got diagnosed" post out in the next few days
- Got the new table and bed! Only set up the dining room table so far, which looks really nice, and is much bigger at a 6 seater, with the chance to go up to 12, which will be perfect for us hosting Anna's family over Xmas
- My recommendations site has been a little awkward to publish content to, as the post-types that existing Micropub clients use don't quite fit within what I want to do, so I've decided I'm going to need to port my autoconfiguring editor to a form that everyone can use (or at least, not have hardcoded code to manage the two identities I had at the time I set it up. Although it'd be good to play around with my Go libraries more, I think I'll put it on the Architect Framework (maybe with TypeScript this time?) to give me a super low cost and quicker ability to ship code
- Ahead of her first birthday tomorrow ðŸ¥º Cookie's been giving us hope with being generally quite chill and cuddly
- Considering porting some of my Kubernetes-hosted Spring Boot services to Go, or at least using a smaller buildpack, so I can save some resources + money
- Been getting more time with Morph in the living room, and this afternoon, we had both of them sleeping in the same room - Cookie on the footstool and Morph on his tower
- Bit worried about Morph as today he's barely eaten his food ðŸ¥º

Watched:

- _Dynasty_
- _Star Trek: Deep Space 9_
- _She Hulk: Attorney at Law_
- _House of the Dragon_
- _Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power_
