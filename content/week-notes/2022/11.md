Birthday week!

- Finished the migration of my Matomo stats to a new Heztner service, which is nice to have it super speedy and cheaper, and have a five year old server destroyed!
- Was good to have a double therapy session this week, although we didn't do _too_ much, but hoping that I'll get some more booked while I'm between jobs
- Was lovely to have Carol at Homebrew
- Having a bit of back-and-forth around IP rights with my new contract, ðŸ¤ž it'll be solved this coming week
- My birthday!
  - Had a lovely chilled day, hanging at home and then off to see _The Batman_
  - Was nice to have our first meal out - Chiquitos after the cinema was very quiet, but was nice food
- Blogged about OpenSSF Scorecards, as I'd chatted with a colleague - in another department - and wanted to apply it to Wiremock, so finally got around to documenting it
- In personal projects:
  - Retired Bridgy Meetup support, as it's no longer viable with the RESTful API
  - Solved Kubernetes issues blocking me from having post-deploy and google-fit working with secrets - naturally blogging about them - which simplifies a lot of things, and was really nice to have the elusive problem sorted
  - Solved a fun issue with `URL`s not being equal to each other, meaning inconsistent experience while trying to authenticate was a bit annoying
  - Fixed some issues with books-mf2 which produced invalid MF2 JSON
  - Added cite support for my reads, so they can now be retrieved from books-mf2, rather than being hand-crafted using a mix of books-mf2 and hand-crafted JSON
  - Tweaked my birthday CSS to use [confetti.js](https://confetti.js.org/) and add a "sponsor me" notice more prominently, to no avail
  - Created opengraph-mf2, as part of a pipe for more generic cites
- Been doing a few more COVID tests this week - which have been negative - as Anna's had some sniffles, coughing and sneezing this week, and been off work
- Meant we cancelled my birthday get together on Saturday for risk of not infecting everyone, but had a distanced catchup with Carol and Thom which was nice, and gave us a chance to have some time with Juno too! Morph was _not_ happy though, growling loudly enough that we could hear him through the glass ðŸ˜… He didn't seem too put off by his presence though, and handled it quite nicely
- Got measurements for our new doggo Ella, and she's only _20cm high_ which is incredibly small and teeny tiny and I'm very excited about how iccle she'll be, but also concerned that she'll be giving us backache ðŸ˜…
- Headed to the family for a couple of days of birthday celebrations
- After starting looking at integration testing Spring (Boot) HTTP clients with Wiremock as well as existing OkHttp articles, I started putting together a better sample repo for it, but not quite finished it on the train journey
- Got some lovely presents from everyone
- We've made some great progress with the house being prepared for Ella, and I even got around to strimming the lawn, which looks much nicer
- Enjoyed a lot of Quordle together
- May have saved a bee's life this evening at my parents'
  - While in the bathroom earlier, I heard a persistent buzzing, and wondered if maybe a bee was stuck in the fan?
  - Turns out the bee was caught in a spider web, and was in the process of a spider further binding it in web / maybe trying to eat it
  - I managed to find a wrapping paper roll - which was needed to get me the right length of implement to reach the web - and knocked the bee and spider down
  - Then ran downstairs, and managed to pick up the bee - still in web - and get it out of the gap in the guttering it fell into, and shoo away the spider
  - Then took ~15 minutes to try and slowly de-web the bee, and get it comfortable that it was free
  - Unfortunately one leg was a bit damaged, and I'm not sure it had much energy left, so left some water and honey out for it, and ðŸ¤ž it will drink some and be safe, but may have died by the morning

Watched:

- _The Batman_
- _Vacation Friends_
- _Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates_
- _The Boys: Diabolical_
- _The Lovebirds_
- _Why Him?_
- _Zak George's Dog Revolution_
- _The Big Bang Theory_ (begrudgingly)
