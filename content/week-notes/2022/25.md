A busy week at work, a few evenings of Cookie care, and it not being _as_ warm

- First therapy for a while, which went OK, and I need to get a block booking set up for the coming weeks
- Cookie had a vet's visit, partly to check up on her hay-fever, but also getting a vaccine
- A bit more Cookie care than usual as Anna's been out and about, with mixed results
- HWC wasn't quite as busy as I'd hoped - but was nice to have James there, and we had some good chats, before Cookie decided I should spend time convincing her that Anna would be back soon
- Another good dog training - Cookie won again 🏆 - but devalued slightly by her being quite far from the other dogs during the sessions, so next time we're going to get a more central location and work on her listening to us when she's closer to distractions
- Not yet got my work blog post out, but hoping it'll be next couple of days 🤞
- New service at work went live and it's been great to see how quickly a new service - and consumers - can be shipped 🚀
- Partially written a couple of blog posts, but not yet got round to finishing them
- Morph ventured into the living room for ~30 seconds, and Cookie didn't completely lose her shit, but also wasn't super chill overall. Still, progress!
- Cookie shuddering with anticipated excitement when seeing a dog on a walk was so cute
- At Gedling park today Cookie ended up barking at a statue of a rabbit, and was quite suspicious of it 😅
- First paycheck with my normal salary, as my first month's paycheck was with my starting bonus, so it's nice to see my usual earnings 🤑
- Cookie's been waking me up for a bit more in the mornings, and it's not always been easy to get back to sleep
- Cookie has been pretty cute with cuddles, and got _very_ excited when I was looking at her and saying "lick" and licking my lips, so she jumped up and gave me some kisses 😻
