This week was sponsored by [One More Time - Worakls Remix](https://open.spotify.com/track/6jINk60m9xyHPVbeVih4nF?si=67106d36620b49dc) being on repeat. I could've get enough of it and it itched my brain just right

- Finished _Stray_
- Had a bit of a stressed time opening up _Rogue Legacy 2_ to find that my saves had disappeared, but turns out it's [a known issue](https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/z66xax/how_to_fix_rogue_legacy_2_saves_disappearing/), which meant I needed to open a terminal on my games console to move things around. Bit of a weird experience, but glad to have the control
- Had a very ADHD moment in _Rogue Legacy 2_ of being distracted and forgetting to go back to spend ~65k coins on upgrades, which had taken me ~30 minutes to accumulate in a very good run
- Swapped out the lampshade for the light up to the loft room
- Got some PRs merged with Renovate around the handling of Go modules, which was cool as they were a little more involved in the codebase than I've done before
- Finally did some of my Xmas shopping, as I'd been getting a little stressed about it **??**
- A good few days resting **??**
- It's been hecking cold **??**
  - Had a lot of fires this week **??**
  - Managed to chop _some_ wood but mostly difficult to do so
  - Walks with Cookie over lunch
  - Cookie's been surprisingly OK, and we've even had some lie-ins
- COVID recovery - I spent a few days off work to **??**
- Unfortunately Anna got symptom-y on Monday, so had a couple of days off too
- One day while holding Morph in my arms, Cookie jumped up and bit his tail ðŸ˜¬
- Cookie's been mostly very cute and has made it nice for recovering this week
- Been playing some _DLC Quest_ today
- Made a - practice - ham, but unfortunately didn't quite cook it long enough, so it was a little bit too tough. Going to need to get another to practice before the proper Christmas ham
- Cookie found the sound of popping candy in my mouth extremely exciting
- (Re) learned how to do a duck call with my mouth, much to Cookie's excitement, too
- Had to cancel the friends' Christmas party on Saturday as we were still a little too COVID-y to safely mingle, which was a shame
- Did not get any talks accepted to FOSDEM, and **??**
- Gave Morph his catnip-filled rat toy for the first time since Cookie arrived, which he was **??**. Cookie was puzzled as to why he was able to play with something she couldn't, but **??**.
- Morph's been getting on the counter a few times ðŸ˜  Not impressed by the behaviour and been telling him off, but doesn't seem to take the hint. He did lick the lid of a soup tub onto the floor, as Cookie was found a little later chewing away at it ðŸ˜…
