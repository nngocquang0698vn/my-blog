- A different HWC this week - had Mark and Chris join, and was nice to chat about Static Site Generators, and Mark's new improvements to their site
- I got very close - but not quite close enough - to having my contract sorted, so I'll be enjoying another week's break between jobs
- Met dogs, TN
- Easter weekend
  - Had Anna's family on Saturday for lunch which was nice, and Cookie for the most part was OK
  - A couple of times of Klara running around near her did put her a bit on edge, but mostly was OK
- Cookie's had a couple of lie-ins with me, post her 0600 loo break with Anna, and it's been very nice having a bit longer in bed with her
