My first week at the Data Standards Authority!

- A quiet week starting things off **??**
- Did my first bit of code review on my first day, and got my first PR in on the second day `:clapping:`
- Found that there's a really great life-work balance so far, and I've found it to be **??**.
- Without a tonne of things to immediately jump into, **??**, but it's also leading to me being able to have a bit more **??**

- The super flexible approach to working habits is making it really chilled - I'm enjoying the approach from Charles and **??**
- With not as much work to do, it's been much easier to switch off - I'm sure as things start **??**, but hopefully by then I'll have learned a bit more control and restraint about life-work balance!
- First trip to the office on Wednesday:
  - Was nice to meet people in person, especially so early
  - Had some great sessions in person that would've been different **??** - **??**
  - Was a very reasonable start (0813 train) and managed to work on both journeys, so banked some hours, and found like it was a great commute
  - Went out for a drink after work, and was nice to **??**
  - Felt surprisingly COVID comfortable, likely because it wasn't super packed, nor rush hour
- Been nicely welcomed by everyone, and it definitely feels like how I'd expect being in a startup / small company - DSA is over a dozen people!
- Managed to get most of the training sorted, so should be free to start getting stuck in a bit more **??**
- It's been very odd being on my desktop for work - I've been so used to the split between work and home that it's odd there now not being a split. It's also quite nice, because I've been able to manage my music more easily, **??**
  I'm thinking at some point I may get a new laptop, as my XPS13 is getting on a bit, and it'll be  **??**

- Got my API-related links in for Link Friday, which was pretty cool!
- Had a good start to the **??** with the GDS folks, joining Infrastructure Weekly, `#club-blogging`, and learning about at least how the GDS approaches their tech
- Been nice but weird - Anna x-Slack

- After listening to [_Why Neovim?_](https://changelog.com/podcast/457), I've taken this week's **??** to **??**
  - **??** better experience
  - **??**

- Started work on migrating to using Spring Security's OAuth2 resource server, and enabling JWT support
- Morph's got back to being on edge
- Morph was snuggled into the blanket, and then stretched out, accidentally catching the blanket with his claws, and [wrapping himself up in it](https://media.jvt.me/87ae3fc6f4.jpeg), which was super cute, and it's the first time he's actually stayed under the blanket!

- Replaced the knackered central heating control with a new one - and even gone smart with a Nest!
- Got smart heating
  - Missed the initial chat on Wednesday, but was glad to be there for the install
  - Noticing around 1700 on Friday that the heating was showing as being "up to temperature in 30 minutes" for over an hour, which didn't seem right. Turns out that it just wasn't on at all, and after waiting some more to see if it worked, **??**. Had a bit of a frustrating **??** and then got in touch. Fortunately they came early in the morning and it turns out a wire got nudged
  - electric blanket **??**
  - Been very cool having the ability to actually schedule it - after the controls being bust, and us only having to boost it - and keep an eye on it much more easily
- Finally set up the Google Nest Hub
  - Set up the photo frame mode with photos that I should really have got printed by now, but it's a nice touch, and it's especially nice getting to see all of them
