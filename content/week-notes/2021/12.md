- Back to work after a week off, and fortunately not missed much
- Not done any prep for my talk ðŸ™ƒ but have had some thoughts about it
- Done a fair bit of Chef stuff this week - some of it between Apex
  - Learned the the difference betweeen lightweight and annotated Git tags this week, but helped sort M8B's Chef upload issue
  - Chef Pipelines are now basically ready, until the upload/Kitchen stuff can be done next PI
  - Got some good learnings about all the ways to get Jenkins to parse Chef testing output
  - Got the basis for Kitchen testing and versioning, which I'm happy with
- Started putting clothes into the wardrobe in the bedroom and into the wardrobe room
- Finally bought a few things for the house we've needed for a while
- Matomo died, due to out of disk space, and of course I couldn't then recover it because as my most locked down server, I can't SSH on with a password (if I had it, that is) and my SSH keys didn't work as they've not been updated on it since reinstalling my machines
  - By the time I'd got a Hetzner server finally ready, the server was up and working again, but was pretty close!
- A weekend without takeaways - had pizza, steak and (our style) roast though so been a very successful weekend
- Finished the last of the lovely Seward honey
- Morph's been a bit difficult this week
  - Definitely heard him yowling/crying at the front door in the early hours, and wanting to be let in/out by doors
  - He snuck on the counter one lunch lunch, licking at some chicken skin we'd left out - and then the next day ended up spraying there, on the counter, which he's done only a couple of times in about 7 years, so really not impressed
  - Had a very stressed Wednesday
  - Took him to the vets to see if they had any suggestions - they're running tests - but it was quite fun sitting in the car watching all the other visitors - a three legged doggo who was very excited to be going home, a cute little white Scotty that was excited by everything going on, and **??**
  - It was especially fun getting Morph into his carry case - he was nice and sleepy so we thought it'd be easy, but he woke up pretty quickly, yowled at me and almost ripped my tshirt, then clung onto Anna's **??** jumper, so we ended up laying it down and literally pushing his bum until he got in **??**
- An unexpected Sunday of chatting with the fam about the conservatory drama
- Had a weird dream about exams at (maybe) Uni, and then being at school with Kelvin, Maisam and Niral, and the school somehow requiring 20-minute busrides between buildings, and also Rakki Rakkas being in Northwood? Very weird
- Good Ring Fit week - albeit Monday's was actually on Sunday
- Re-done my sums, and feeling a bit better
- Done nothing with all the emails re windows I've had
- Feeling a bit better after catching up on sleep this weekend

Watched:
