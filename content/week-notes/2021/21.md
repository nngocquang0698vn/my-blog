- Rich Fairbank strategy this week - that I didn't attend - meant that the days were frontloaded with work, and afternoons were pretty quiet
- Ended up doing what I usually do with a free house - the same as I usually do
- Had a good chat with Kieran and picked up on a few areas for blog posts - and chatting with the QE community - about how better we can write our tests
- Cute cat from next door made it inside the perimiter, and Morph just let it! He gave them a bit of a stare down, but they walked past
- Made some pretty good cost savings for Chef pipelines by replacing `m4.medium`s with `t3a.medium`s - its per-second billing masively saved, even when running 10x the number of instances ($70 vs $0.20)!
- Found a bug in my post-deploy cron config due to Spring's different setup, and it was sending every 6 minutes, not 6 hours - woops!
- Managed to resolve the threading / authentication issues with my post-deploy / google-fit sending
- Discovered that nothing has been notifying me cause I added the wrong secret for it - all resolved now!
- Had some difficulty digging into logstash-logback-encoder and slf4j-test
