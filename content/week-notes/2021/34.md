A three day week:

- Friday off for C1
- Morph has been obsessed with the local wildlife - he's brought in two dead mice, and one still alive
  - We put his bell on him again, to which he immediately started spraying inside again, so I guess we know how he feels about that
- Signed up for a gym membership, and had our first swim using it, which was very nice. It was nice getting back to it after so long, and it was good having the sauna and steam room, too!
- Finalised my start/end date, and been chatting with Charles ahead of it - getting more and more excited to start!
- Charlie's leaving do got me very emotional - it gave me a sign of what was to come when I do leave, and he said some lovely things about how I was "the best tech lead" and that I was the "beating heart of the team", so ðŸ¥º
- Cat's got COVID - but is fine
- Had some good work around BOMs this week at work, and proving some patterns out for library usage
- Thursday blog - nice to just sit down and write, and getting **??**
- Some not great sleeping
- Lots of (unnecessary) tasty treats
- Had a good IndieAuth session on Saturday evening with the IndieWeb crew
- Went into town for lunch, ice cream, and a walk over to the bike shop on Monday, followed by our first go on the e-scooters - a nice Monday off!
- Anna had her first trip to the office
- Busy week around Anna's parents on Wednesday
- Very happy to welcome [Flora](/mf2/2021/08/qq1gu/) to the world
- Still having difficulty with Gherkin Formatting
- Had a good catchup with Chris generally and about my leaving
- Starting to prepare my handovers with the team
- Spent most of Sunday playing _Link's Awakening_ together, with Morph on my lap
- To avoid needing to go to the doctors to get my stye looked at, I've finally started looking after it myself and it's magically fixing itself :joy:
- We've got neighbours again - it feels very odd having people next door again

Watched:

- _The Good Place_
- _American Psycho_
- _Downtown Abbey_
