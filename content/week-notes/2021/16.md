A pretty good week:

- The end of planning, and kicking off the PI with some interesting stuff
- _Finally_ measured up the windows, drew some diagrams, and am ready to send them off to the various companies for quotes tomorrow<span style="display: none">, after a weird dream where one of my wedding vows was to do them</span>
- My site got pretty popular this week after Software Lead Weekly featured my Blogumentation post
- Met some of the team on Saturday in West Bridgford and had a lovely time in the sun, [just chilling in the park](https://media.jvt.me/0cb5900c43.jpeg), and had a good couple of hours just chilling and chatting. Was nice seeing Shama, Bethany and Prashant in person for the first, time too! Tushar brought Doughnotts, too, which definitely helped too  ðŸ˜‹
- Got my [first contribution to Spotless raised](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/pull/853), which I'm looking forward to using, and enjoyed trying out Reflection a little more
- Fixed my step counts not publishing
- Had a pretty awful sleep after a rather large first German Donner Kebab, given Chapati Junction being closed for Ramadan, which wasn't a great way to lead into the weekend
- Got things almost done for Test Kitchen setup, and had some good feedback from consumer teams about the usefulness of the new pipeline setup
- Although Morph seemed to be generally better and we thought he'd turned a corner, he's not had a great second half of the week
- Made an awesome [crimble crumble](/mf2/2021/04/olqwn/)!
- Had a bit of a panic with my desktop not working today, and no displays showing up, but it ended up working in the end
- Excited for the new season of Apex Legends after the reveals this week
- Got the first Asda pizza of the new house! Although it took a bit longer in the current oven, it was perfect, and went well with the chicken dippers starter

Watched:

- A very good end to _The Falcon and the Winter Soldier_
- _Modern Family_
- _The Five Year Engagement_
- _Molly's Game_
- _Drifters_
- _Life As We Know It_
- _The Witcher_
