A week focussed around looking forward to the new job:

- After many, many weeks of waiting, it's finally happened - I've got the official job offer for the CDDO, and I've given in my notice!
  - It's meant it's been a pretty emotionally exhausting week - with the relief of background checks being OK, the mixed emotions of leaving, and the excitement of something new
  - Took a few days to get the blog post prepped, and thanks to Anna for proofreading before Thursday standup so I could post it as soon as the team had been told
  - Was odd telling the team - definitely would've been nicer if it were in person, although unfortunately not everyone was around for the news, and I do feel a bit bad that they heard through my post on `#uk-se`, rather than in person - but also with all the gossip going around, it was much better to have been through that than someone gossiping!
    - That being said, I'm glad I'm worthy of such gossip - sounds like there's been a lot of back and forth and "why's he bothering doing [this work] if he's just going to leave?"
  - I've had some lovely messages, but it's been really nice - I feel like I should leave more often
  - I'm 99% sure the person who let slip about me looking elsewhere is the person I first told at work - and who I asked to keep it secret - but ü§∑
  - I've had a tonne of post views on LinkedIn (~4500 impressions) and Twitter (~3500 impressions) and ~500 views on the post itself - and it's been fun constantly checking my stats/on each platform
  - Got some [celebratory Doughnotts](https://media.jvt.me/5998b67a4c.jpeg) which were very nommy!
  - Found a number of broken links on Saturday in my announce post, which is pretty mortifying!
- Some more slow work on the Gherkin formatter, which is proving to be a rather painful endeavour - but [having some more progress](/mf2/2021/08/igdrs/), albeit with further rewrites
- Had a nice chat with Rich and Soph - who surprised us with the fact that they'd bought a house and moved in?!
- Capital One have given the whole business next Friday off as holiday which is nice - so looking forward to this week being a three day week üëè
- Saturday was spent recovering from a long week, and Sunday's been a mix of the same, and some more on gherkin formatting
- I think Morph had made a friend with neighbour kitty - he was sitting opposite my office with them, looking at each other for a bit, then he went to scratch a tree, then back to looking at each other - but surprisingly chilled - hoping this is him turning a corner!
- Finished up the garage door's magnetic holder
- Got Serverless Wiremock working internally - pending the official contributions upstream being reviewed - and it's made some pretty significant improvements (~40-60% request time improvement!)
