A stressful run up to Christmas - especially with a level of still not knowing if things were going to be cancelled at the last minute, or last minute positive tests - and not feeling particularly festive:

- Finished the rest of the ham on Monday, and thoroughly enjoyed constantly eating the ham whenever opening the fridge, like last Christmas
- Glad that Anna was over the worst of what she'd had and back to herself by Tuesday
- Positive last few days at work:
  - Got through documentation of our current (design) decisions and choices, so next year we don't have to work as hard to remember why we did the things we did!
  - Caught a case where our contract wasn't being returned correctly from the API so got a chance to add JSON Schema validation to the MockMVC tests, which is the first time I've done that, so that's cool (usually it had been Cucumber/contract testing level)
  - Had a bit of a look into Spring Cloud Contracts and how we'd integrate it into the progression of the Federated API Discovery model
  - Made some great progress with bootstrapping our Spectral API linting, so we can more easily automate and shift left the API Assessments we do, as well as giving us faster feedback on rules we're writing, as well as being able to meaningfully know whether things work or not!
- Mum and Dad came to pick me up on Wednesday, and we had lunch and a catch up at mine before heading back
  - Managed to work for most of the journey - although had to stop a couple of times for a few minutes as I wasn't feeling well - but made very good progress with Spectral, and was happy I chose it as a thing to do
    - although I did work a bit later on Wednesday to make sure that I'd got it working, and a few outstanding things stayed in my mind until late that night
    - managed to finish it all off on Thursday and publish a package for it too, so I'm looking forward to us, and hopefully others, using it more
    - had some fun trying to get it uploaded automagically to NPM
- Happy to see [a spoiler-free _Matrix Resurrections_ review](/mf2/2021/12/xcp4e/) that has made me not as sad to miss it in the cinema
- Had some _Spiderman: No Way Home_ spoilers, but fortunately nothing more than the characters in it
- Hoping to get back to Vibrancy migration early next year - which is a shame as I could really do with private posts right now
- Getting a little annoyed by seeing over the last month that some of my posts on Matomo as showing up as shared through Facebook (/WhatsApp/Messenger), but not knowing where they're from, or why those specific posts are being shared
- CDDO are now officially off GDS Slack, so we're going to have to work a bit harder to improve our collaboration
- Just as I was about to leave all the Lego packages arrived so when I'm back home we'll get a chance to build them all - and I've already found quite a few others to get next
- Had some Lindt spreadable - it was quite nice, but very similar to Nutella
- Found it a bit odd being away from home for the first time, and especially so being able to see what's going on when the external cameras were seeing motion detected
- Saw the cousins which was very nice - had some good food outside and was nice to catch up
- Had a nice chilled Christmas
  - Had a very nice brunch [of pain au chocolat and cinnamon swirls made from a Jus-Rol kit, with smoked salmon](https://media.jvt.me/f174073db2.jpeg)
  - Got some presents I'd self-gifted, but also got some nice surprises!
  - Everyone was happy with their presents from me too, which was a relief!
  - We had a lovely setup for dinner and were [all very happy to be together for it](https://media.jvt.me/7a89836d8f.jpeg), and the Côte At Home dinner was generally [very yum](https://media.jvt.me/4fb8018f0f.jpeg) and easy
- Missed doing my dailies, but glad to have the Switch to play _LEGO: DC Super Villains_
- Had a lot of lovely food - chicken shawarma, Kaki-style pizza, (mint) chocolate sauce and ice cream and pork with basil
- Had some good fun doing jigsaws
- Haven't done much reading
