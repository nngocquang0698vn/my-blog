A stressful run up to Christmas - especially with a level of still not knowing if things were going to be OK / **??** - and not feeling particularly festive:

- Anna felt better by Tuesday, which was good, as **??**
- Positive last few days at work:
  - Got through documentation of our current (design) decisions and choices, so next year we don't have to work as hard to remember why we did the things we did!
  - Caught a case where our contract wasn't being returned correctly from the API so got a chance to add JSON Schema validation to the MockMVC tests, which is the first time I've done that, so that's cool (usually it had been Cucumber/contract testing level)
  - Had a bit of a look into Spring Cloud Contracts and how we'd integrate it into the progression of the Federated API Discovery model
  - Spectral
- Mum and Dad came to pick me up on Wednesday, and we had lunch and a catch up at mine before heading back
  - Managed to work for most of the journey - although had to stop a couple of times for a few minutes as I wasn't feeling well - but made very good progress with Spectral, and was happy I chose it as a thing to do
    - although I did work a bit later on Wednesday to make sure that I'd got it working, and a few outstanding things stayed in my mind until late that night
    - managed to finish it all off on Thursday and publish a package for it too, so I'm looking forward to us, and hopefully others, using it more
- Happy to see [a spoiler-free Matrix Resurrections review](/mf2/2021/12/xcp4e/) that has made me not as sad to miss it in the cinema
