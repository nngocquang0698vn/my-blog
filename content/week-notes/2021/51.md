A stressful run up to Christmas - especially with a level of still not knowing if things were going to be OK / **??** - and not feeling particularly festive:

- Anna felt better by Tuesday, which was good, as **??**
- Positive last few days at work:
  - Got through documentation of our current (design) decisions and choices, so next year we don't have to work as hard to remember why we did the things we did!
  - Caught a case where our contract wasn't being returned correctly from the API so got a chance to add JSON Schema validation to the MockMVC tests, which is the first time I've done that, so that's cool (usually it had been Cucumber/contract testing level)
  - Had a bit of a look into Spring Cloud Contracts and how we'd integrate it into the progression of the Federated API Discovery model
  - Made some great progress with bootstrapping our Spectral API linting, so we can more easily automate and shift left the API Assessments we do, as well as giving us faster feedback on rules we're writing, as well as being able to meaningfully know whether things work or not!
- Mum and Dad came to pick me up on Wednesday, and we had lunch and a catch up at mine before heading back
  - Managed to work for most of the journey - although had to stop a couple of times for a few minutes as I wasn't feeling well - but made very good progress with Spectral, and was happy I chose it as a thing to do
    - although I did work a bit later on Wednesday to make sure that I'd got it working, and a few outstanding things stayed in my mind until late that night
    - managed to finish it all off on Thursday and publish a package for it too, so I'm looking forward to us, and hopefully others, using it more
    - had some fun trying to get it uploaded automagically to NPM
- Happy to see [a spoiler-free Matrix Resurrections review](/mf2/2021/12/xcp4e/) that has made me not as sad to miss it in the cinema
- Hoping to get back to Vibrancy migration early next year
- Getting a little annoyed by seeing over the last month that some of my posts on Matomo as showing up as shared through Facebook (/WhatsApp/Messenger), but not knowing where they're from, or why those specific posts are being shared
- CDDO are now officially off GDS Slack, so we're going to have to work a bit harder to improve our collaboration
- Just as I was about to leave all the Lego packages arrived so when I'm back home we'll get a chance to build them all
