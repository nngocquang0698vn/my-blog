A quietish week at work, but a very loud few days with fireworks:

- Dropped in and out of WiT on Thursday to check in on Morph (due to Diwali fireworks)
- Spent Friday night with Morph
  - Under sofa
  - Under blanket
- Found Hugo's `ignoreFIles` which will be much more useful when I'm on my current laptop, as writing posts, I don't care about i.e. bookmarks
- Didn't get around to posting my links for the API community - as I'd not yet got enough good stuff - but read a few good ones over the weekend that I'll share
- Started - and finished - the Secret Sauce blog post, which took about three days on and off to write
- New season of Apex is exciting! New map, the CAR is awesome, Ash is quite fun to play with
- Got the API Community links published publicly, which was really awesome, especially as it's something I've wanted to do for a while, with an RSS feed too, and now we're looking at whether we have a different site for it
- May not use Go, based on GDS

Watched:

- _Sex Education_
- _Space Force_
