- After much deliberation, I decided on a [hairstyle change](/mf2/2021/12/v2uo6/) (from [inspiration](https://www.menshairstylestoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Short-Haircut-Combed-Over-Undercut.jpg)) and am really happy with it. Definitely been feeling myself a bit this week
  - Was a bit surprised in myself for going out on Monday lunch, while it was raining
