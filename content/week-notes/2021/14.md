A pretty alright four day week:

- Got my talk for TN done ahead of next week!
  - Was pretty happy I got it done so far ahead of the event, as we were all quite sure that I was gonna be doing it live
  - Felt much better, having the dry run and recording on Monday
  - Feedback from Andrew and Carol was super helpful, and meant that Thursday evening I got it recorded, and it was just off my mind!
- Prep for PI planning has gone well, and things are looking good for the next week
- Had a really bad sleep ahead of work on Tuesday, which meant it was quite a slow day, but was alright given it was coming back after the long weekend
- Some more vivid dreams this week:
  - May have fought one of my colleagues, fled the scene and ran for miles
  - Found cats hiding in the spare room cause they burrowed in? Very weird, and no idea how Morph didn't know there were _so many_ cats in the house, although wondered if that was what caused him to be like he is
  - There was definitely something like a plane crash, or a not quite plane crash?
  - Had a holiday to Australia, aside from the snake attacks
- Played a good game of Five Finger Showdown with the team, and learned soem cool things about everyone
- Had some good games of Apex this week
- Had a nice Saturday with Anna's fam at Clumber Park, although I definitely didn't dress warmly
  - Had a very cute breakfast with Morph resting his head on the side of his bed, poking out and keeping one eye on us while he napped
- Got our window film up in the bedroom for a bit more privacy from nebby neighbours, and shuffled things around
- Doing some more good stuff with the Chef pipelines, and getting things into a place that I'm going to be especially pleased with!
- Managed to get the clock on the boiler changed, after much difficulty
- Made a stab at sorting the toilet, but have since procrastinated with calling the plumber. Maybe next week I'll do it?
