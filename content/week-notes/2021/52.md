Back home again after a week at the parents' for Christmas, and very much enjoying being back home:

- Had a lot of nice sofa time with Anna, and some of Morph, watching TV, reading, and chilling
- After my order last week for a few custom Lego Brickheadz designs, and the pieces delivered while I was away, I spent a lot of the week very slowly building The Grinch and Fuse (pictures will be done soon - still a couple of pieces need to be added) and Thanos from my Secret Santa
  - Was a good thing to do on the sofa, with lots of tubs, trays, and space to put everything
  - Was a not very good thing to do on the sofa as it was very noisy and distracting for anyone else in the room ðŸ˜…
  - Definitely should've done an inventory before building things so I could've more easily checked that all the pieces had arrived, as I'm still trying to work out if there are pieces missing or not
- Had our first walk with new pup Juno ðŸ–¤ [and saw a herd of deer](/mf2/2022/01/gfyzy/)
- Not found anything good in the January sales just yet
- Got my booster jab (Moderna), which gave me a worse reaction than the previous jabs:
  - Flu symptoms, and a bad headache, but fortunately resolved with some paracetamol, even though I didn't sleep amazingly
  - Definitely would've been worse if I'd have been at work
- New Year's Eve was a bit lacklustre
  - _Death to 2021_ took a bit of the life out of the sails
  - After days of deliberating on dinner, Chapati Junction ended up not being available on the night so we had to pivot, and wait a while as could be expected
  - Managed to just about make it to midnight - at which point my award was announced, and Morph got very nervous with all the fireworks
- Was very honoured [to have received an OpenUK award](/mf2/2022/01/nej8r/)
- Did a few bits of Job DSL maintenance
- Morph has been trying our patience this week, and has spent a lot of time in the conservatory
- Taken down all the Xmas decorations
- _Don't Look Up_ prompted some "fun" discussions about survival in a pre-/post-apocalyptic world
- _Dopesick_ was an excellent, hard-hitting series, and Michael Keaton, Kaitlyn Dever, and Michael Stuhlbarg were really amazing. It reminded me of being on Diazepam and Morphine while recovering from my appendix, albeit I was very controlled on usage, and the amounts were low, we could see how easily I could've been hooked if it were much more addictive
- A more intentional break from WhatsApp and notifications
- Back to reading _Tiamat's Wrath_ towards the end of the week as Andrew's caught up very speedily
- Looked into a couple of bugs for Spring Cloud Contract
- A little later than planned (while still at C1) but got around to writing Cucumber tests with Dagger
