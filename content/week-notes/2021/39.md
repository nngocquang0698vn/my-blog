  - Got some more appreciation of the great stuff being done across the Civil Service
- Had some lovely meals out - 
- Spent some time with Anna's parents
- Wednesday evening onwards my social battery was running out
- Had the weekend to recover from the holiday
- Morph very meowy, not settling
- Made some very good progess on my first Architect framework project - rsvp-calendar - today and hope to have it out in the next few days
