- Started the week off pretty well with a lie in (as I'd forgotten to re-enable my Ring Fit morning alarms), and took our leftover Ohanne's chips and chicken and made a pretty good [loaded fries](https://media.jvt.me/4ca2b6fdc7.jpeg)
- Couldn't use Twitter for a bit on Wednesday, as the app kept crashing after muting someone who was being promoted from a topic
- had a dream about Lombok
- McD
- Went to Lidl (twice in the same morning) to get bits for the week, which has meant this week has been drowning in Morph's meowing begging for chicken
- doughnotts
- Thu morning positive ceremonies - gaming / chat?
