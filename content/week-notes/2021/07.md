- Started the week off pretty well with a lie in (as I'd forgotten to re-enable my Ring Fit morning alarms), and took our leftover Ohanne's chips and chicken and made a pretty good [loaded fries](https://media.jvt.me/4ca2b6fdc7.jpeg)
- Couldn't use Twitter for a bit on Wednesday, as the app kept crashing after muting someone who was being promoted from a topic
- had a dream about Lombok
- McD
- Went to Lidl (twice in the same morning) to get bits for the week, which has meant this week has been drowning in Morph's meowing begging for chicken
- doughnotts
- Thu morning positive ceremonies - gaming / chat?
- Morph has managed to hurt my nose with his aggressive kitty kisses
- Getting hounded by my team on Friday for logging on while I was on holiday (albeit to check calendar to book windows folks coming round) was nice, and pretty proud of myself to have not checked anything
- Enjoyed being able to edit my week notes through the week "live", rather than updating Google Keep and then writing them later in the week - still wondering if there's something better I can do for convenience to easily open my latest post to edit
- Done some budgeting for the year, and realised that, although I'm still really quite well off, it's not by the margin I had last year - who knew that buying a big house would result in less savings??
- Got committer access to Cucumber, which was surprising but awesome!
- Only one Ring Fit this week, but hoping next week will be better
- Morph has been trying our patience as ever, while being as cute as is possible to make it less annoying. Also been pushing our 2 seater sofa to its limits ðŸ˜‚
- A stressful Asda shop, with no pizza to show for it
- Got the first Easter egg + Lindt bunny of the season
- Three nights of bad sleeping habits

Watched:
