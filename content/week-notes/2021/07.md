- Started the week off pretty well with a lie in (as I'd forgotten to re-enable my Ring Fit morning alarms), and took our leftover Ohanne's chips and chicken and made a pretty good [loaded fries](https://media.jvt.me/4ca2b6fdc7.jpeg)
- Couldn't use Twitter for a bit on Wednesday, as the app kept crashing after muting someone who was being promoted from a topic
- Another week of being able to remember dreams - boring ones like Lombok and code review, to a bit darker
- Went to Lidl (twice in the same morning) to get bits for the week, which has meant this week has been drowning in Morph's meowing begging for chicken
- [Got some Doughnotts to start the three day weekend](/mf2/2021/02/wnt5s/), which we both had off and gave us a bit of breathing room while we worked through some of our TODO lists!
- Had a pretty positive Thursday morning - possibly a mix of a chat with Shama / getting my dailies in before work
- Morph has managed to hurt my nose with his aggressive kitty kisses, although it seems to be a bit better since Thursday
- Getting hounded by my team on Friday for logging on while I was on holiday (albeit to check calendar to book windows folks coming round) was nice, and pretty proud of myself to have not checked anything
- Enjoyed being able to edit my week notes through the week "live", rather than updating Google Keep and then writing them later in the week - still wondering if there's something better I can do for convenience to easily open my latest post to edit
- Done some budgeting for the year, and realised that, although I'm still really quite well off, it's not by the margin I had last year - who knew that buying a big house would result in less savings??
- Got committer access to Cucumber, which was surprising but awesome!
- Only one Ring Fit this week, but hoping next week will be better
- Morph has been trying our patience as ever, while being as cute as is possible to make it less annoying. Also been pushing our 2 seater sofa to its limits, by trying to take a whole seat of space for himself ðŸ˜‚
- A stressful Asda shop, with no pizza to show for it, but stocked up on bits for the week
- Got the first Easter egg + Lindt bunny of the season
- Three nights of bad sleeping habits, but I've been having lie-ins to slightly counter it
- Spent all of my crafting materials in _Apex Legends_ while they went a bit further for the anniversary, so I've now got some cooler cosmetics
- Worked on a few www-api things:
  - Changed my consent screen to allow choosing scope(s) based on what's supported, which I've been meaning to do for a while
  - Worked on a few fixes, and added support for reads syndication to Twitter
- Broke another wine glass
- Finished the non-bonus levels of Mario

Watched:

- _WandaVision_
- _Superstore_
- _South Park_
- _Rick and Morty_
- _The Crown_, in the background while playing Mario
- _Bridesmaids_ with the gang
- Rewatched the season 5 finale of _The Expanse_
