A busy week ahead of the start of a week off:

- Celebrated Anna's parents 50th anniversary
  - Stayed up late, chatting with Howard and learning a bit more about top tips for 50 years!
- "Last" handover with the team showed that we're all ready to go, so this week off will hopefully show the team they don't need me, and it'll mean I'm ready to go
- Spent some time helping Asgard + Magic8Ball on their OPL migrations
