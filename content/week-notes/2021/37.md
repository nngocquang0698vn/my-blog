My penultimate five day week at Capital One, and the last time going the office before next week's holiday:

- Not the best start to week getting a bit worked up about stuff at work, but turns out it wasn't actually the problem I though it was, and I'd gone off on one for no reason ðŸ˜… - that'll teach me for making assumptions instead of assuming positive intent
- Not the most productive day at the office on Tuesday - although fortunately I didn't have a walk to work in the rain as the forecast said it would be
  - It was a great food day though! I'm definitely going to miss the canteen
  - Had a great time [for Jim's leaving meal at Annie's](https://media.jvt.me/252dc30162.jpeg) - my [Sunday Lunch burger was very good](https://media.jvt.me/704aa3cea6.jpeg), and as my first inside meal it was a bit of a shock to the system, but felt relatively comfortable
- Had a really bad sleep on Tuesday - my back was killing me, and spent about an hour awake in the night waiting for paracetemol to kick in, after at least an hour of very poor sleep
- Got a fair bit done with the house:
  - Got the locks changed
  - Got our first clean with the hopefully new regular cleaners
  - In the process of dealing with the fence
  - More progress with the windows, but not yet a quote
- Still getting a good amount of traffic on my salary post

-

- Family on Saturday
  - Paneer since kaki

- Had [a good catch up with Shaun](https://twitter.com/sdh100Shaun/status/1438951750631895047) - **??**
- Had a really great catchup with Charles
  - Really looking forward to some of the work **??**
  - Excited by the fact I may not need a VPN!
  - Had a really good chat about hybrid working, and it's looking like it'll be much less in "an office" than required
- After several weeks of wanting one, McDonalds have milkshakes again!
- Finding the wind down at work a bit weird - I'm so used to being busy and having many things to do with my downtime that with me imminently leaving, and not wanting chunky pieces of work needing handover, I'm finding it hard to **??**
  - I've been able to get onto things like innersourcing some improvements to my old teams' to hopefully help them out with some of the things they'd want to do if they had the time

Watched:

- _The Matrix Revolutions_
- _Ugly Betty_
- _What If?_
