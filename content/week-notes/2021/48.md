The one with the air fryer:

- A fairly busy week at work with [federated-api-model](https://github.com/co-cddo/federated-api-model)
- Had a routine checkup for Morph at the vet's
  - They've spotted what could be a murmur, and are doing some checks to see if it is, or if it was just because there were dogs in the waiting room, but he is a little bit sensitive about [his little shaved patch on his paw](https://media.jvt.me/ffda5e29ad.jpeg)
  - He definitely didn't enjoy his temperature being taken (for quite an extended period) ðŸ˜¬
- We got our air fryer, which has been a very exciting so far and **??**
  - We've been enjoying having easier access to chicken dippers and chips
  - Also had our first [roast](https://www.jvt.me/mf2/2021/12/owqtq/) tonight which was very good, and took less than an hour between starting prep and finishing eating it!
- An unrestrained weekend of food
- After literally 7 years of on-and-off thinking about the watch I wanted for my 21st birthday gift from my parents, I've _finally_ decided on on the watch I've been looking at for about 3 years ðŸ˜…
- Taking part in my first Advent of Code - although I've not done any this weekend - and have so far enjoyed it. I won't say I've been writing any good code but at least I've been solving the problems and learning a few new tricks in the Ruby stdlib
- Lots of deliveries from Black Friday **??**
- Kicked off the weekend with massages and a bit of a walk around town
- Had a lovely Saturday evening with Emma and Andrew
  - Accidentally almost yeeted Flora when she vommed on me ðŸ˜¬ðŸ˜¬
  -
- I'm helping out with the TN Xmas party, which is going to be _awesome_ - there's some really amazing stuff planned by lots of wonderful people!
- With Wiremock being released, I got a couple of posts up, and am hoping that my ex colleagues will be able to make good use of the new functionality
- Got some good news about some ex-colleagues getting a move onto new jobs
- Few articles out of the door
- Installed the new lights in the spare room, which look really nice, and **??**
- **??**
