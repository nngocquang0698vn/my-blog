- Started the week off poorly with a bad night's sleep
- Had some good progress with fixing Chef pipelines and solving the ever elusive Gemfile-with-ChefDK/Workstation. although `knife-cookbook-doc` still isn't happy
- Morph left us a chonky spider carcus on the island, and has jumped up a couple of times, which is really not OK
- Milk and more are yet again showing they can't cancel / update properly, with double yoghurt coming this week despite being cancelled
- Had an unfortunately stressful Thursday, leading me to multitask through the Hackathon, and then dropping out and leaving my team to work without me, while incident / Chef stuff got in the way
- Did some unexpected cross-team coaching, but found it a really good experience
- Accidentally published these early! Noticed earlier in the week that I'd forgotten to publish them using `draft` scope, so I need to amend my `WeekNotesDecorator` to always post them as a draft
- Spent a bit of the week playing more with micropub.rocks, and have almost got my first PR sorted for it
- Been thinking about indieauth.rocks, and whether we want it to be like an OB Conformance Suite, or like we've currently got with micropub.rocks
- Posted my Job DSL article, which has had less traffic than hoped
- Broke a bowl
- Finally got around to reinstalling my desktop - after a couple of attempts - although I'm thinking the IOWAIT is definitely due to the temporary CPU I got
  - Accidentally `rm *`'d in my home directory, fortunately after everything but dotfiles were backed up

- spring thurs
