A four day week, with a fair bit of stuff done around the house, procrastinating mid-year:

- Cut the grass - naturally in my sliders - and left Morph his favourite spot, although he's not used it
  - But had the unfortunate experience of getting cat poo all over my sliders
- Thought I'd solved the heating timing issue, but ended up just turning off our ability to have hot water
  - Then actually solved the heating timer, although the controls are awful, old, and (physically) painful to use
- Fixed the curtain pull cord in the bedroom
- Got a first pass of the spare room's painting done
  - Listened to some interesting podcasts from the cool stuff GDS is doing
  - Was pretty surprised with how good it mostly looks at our first attempt
- Pretty happy with being able to get some good blog posts out this week
- Lots of cooking this week
- A lovely Sunday afternoon with the crew to celebrate Andrew's upcoming birthday - despite the risk of rain!
  - Audrey gave me some love which was cute
- Plumber finally got around to coming and sorting the drippy tap - just as I managed to perfect the level of dripping
- Procrastinated some more about my mid-year appraisal, ending up working late on Friday to get it to a better place, before finishing it tomorrow
- Got our first service on PAR, and am very excited to ship it tomorrow!
- Made a great start on the shared quotation testing library, and am looking forward to some discussions this week to start progressing it
- Got my first bill for GKE ������������ so looking at cost saving
- Finally had another haircut, so feeling a bit lighter in the head
- Not a great week for Ring Fit
- Had our first Rakki Rakkas in a while, and a Zaap to celebrate us doing a thing

Watched:

- _Pok������mon Detective Pikachu_
- _Archer_
- _Hancock_
- Gave up on _The Sum of All Fears_, as it was very slow
- _Schitt's Creek_
