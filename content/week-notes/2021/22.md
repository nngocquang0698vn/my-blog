A four day weekend, with a fair bit of stuff done around the house:

- Cut the grass - naturally in my sliders - and left Morph his favourite spot, although he's not used it
- Thought I'd solved the heating timing issue, but ended up just turning off our ability to have hot water
- Then actually solved the heating timer, although the controls are awful, old, and (physically) painful to use
- Got a first pass of the spare room's painting done
  - Listened to some interesting podcasts from the cool stuff GDS is doing
- Got some good blog posts out this week
