Honestly can't remember much that has happened this week ðŸ˜… but I'm absolutely shattered right now!

- Made some really good progress with Stubs Service's test coverage, using the new library, and adding test coverage for the missing cases - was really quite happy with how things look, and am looking forward to us having the first innersourcing to see just how speedily we can ship changes!
- Busy weekend prepping the spare room - painting looks really good, and once the cleaners have been, we'll finalise the assembly ahead of Anna's family next weekend
- Got Asda pizza, but may have been a bit risky as Arnold wasn't exactly full of folks who were trying to be the most conscientious
- As we wanted to watch a second part of a TikTok from the gang - and the web app made it so horribly user hostile - I ended up re-downloading TikTok, and so far have had good experience with the algorithm!
- Made my way through the leftover cheeesecake from last weekend, and most of the way through the Gulab Jamboo ðŸ˜‹
- After a long break from Switch, I've played some _Bowser's Fury_ this weekend
- Morph had an excellent outside vom - getting some real height on it
- Installed an Ethernet plug in the spare room
- Not much personal project - or Localstack PR - success this week, been pretty tired so it's been mostly Apex in evenings

Watched:

- _Loki_
- _Thor: Ragnarok_
- _The Imitation Game_
- _Archer_
- _Schitt's Creek_
