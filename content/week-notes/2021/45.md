- Spent a bit of time trying to rearchitect the tests for my IndieAuth resource servers - so I can incrementally move to JWT verification, via "real" token introspection - but having trouble hooking in a mix of Wiremock, Spring Boot, and heavily nested JUnit5 tests
- Had a lovely catch up with Aash and James
- A short day-trip to London
- Kaki's 2 year anniversary
- First in person Homebrew! 

Watched:

- _Shang Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings_

- _Sex Education_
- _The Expanse_
