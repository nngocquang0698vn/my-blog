Returning to work after a week off, for my last full wek at Capital One:

- Fortunately eveyrthing was fine while I was away, so the last handovers and bits of work that I can do are all done
- Last things to do are finishing feedback for folks who've recommended it
- Had some good last catch-ups with various folks
- Had a day at home on my own
- Had our first consultation with the interior designer - exciting start, with some exploratory first questions, and are looking forward to the brief + mood board that comes out of it!
- Windows are measured up, and had a good chat about options
- Cucumber v7 was released, so did some upgrades at work and on personal projects
- Been a good week working on Wiremock - with the Discord there's been an easier opportunity to discuss and collaborate, and am excited to get a bit more stuck in
- Officially registered intent to adopt maintainership of Job DSL
- Started using RSVP Calendar - despite some cert issues - but still not quite ready for external use
- Lovely to see my parents on Saturday
  - Got Cod's Scallops for lunch which was very good - and gave enough leftover chips and beef sauce to give us dinner, too
  - Morph was on top form, giving both of them cuddles and affection, which was very nice
  - Got a 1.4kg box of the two-bite brownies I used to love
  - Got lots of Lego now, with the latest from my parents, so my office is now teeming with opportunity
- Read some of _4.48 Psychosis_
- Did a lot of tidying and sorting in the house, and the garage, this week
- Was nice to see Sarah, Ross and Klara on Sunday, but they didn't end up needing as much garage space as we thought - but at least it's cleared now!
- Booked in Rich and Soph to come stay later in the month
- Morph has been trying to escape a fair bit, and has been screaming at us for reasons unknown - it's getting a little annoying at times ðŸ˜…
- In the lull of a song, heard what sounded like a yowling cat, and rushed downstairs - Morph had been cornered by the ginger cat, who wasn't being aggressive, and in fact was looking at the garden, away from Morph, and yowling a bit. When Morph saw me, he - pardon the pun - walked over incredibly gingerly and quietly so as not to let the ginger Cat spot him
- Electric blanket is now on the bed, and warming it before we get into bed
