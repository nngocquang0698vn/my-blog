My last full wek at Capital One:

- Handovers and last bits of work I can do are now done
- Doing last bits of feedback for folks
- Had a day at home
- Had our first consultation with the interior designer - exciting start, with some exploratory first questions, and are looking forward to the brief + mood board that comes out of it!
- Windows
- 


- Lovely to see my parents on Saturday
  - Cod's Scallops
  - Morph snuggled them both
- RSVP Calendar is in use, but not quite yet ready for others to use
