The one with the new laptop, and the first week of pairing!

- Worried about Morph
- chat with other agencies about our stuff
- Almost hit by car
- Microwaved a mince pie cup
- lean coffee very good
  - API disco stuff
  - sustainability
- had some good discussions about the use of monoliths
- had some weird dreams - **??**, a clown car full of aggressive students, and picking a spot that led to my stomach returning to what it was like a week after my Appendix
- got the contents of my pedestal from Capital One, and it was a bit of a blast from the past going through the stuff and seeing a lot of stickers and **??**
- had a lovely Friday afternoon catch up with Shama
- back and forth on the living room - reshuffled to give us the feel
- trip to London
  - anna headphones
  - old laptop
  - Brandur
  - good start to planning
- the start on the development of the [Federated API Model](https://github.com/alphagov/federated-api-model)
  - really nice paiirng
  - first "proper" work together
  - nice to **?have someon enew to tell the old things ?**
  - bit of a shame to be back to thinking about work outside of work - one walk to Lidl resulted in me thinking about what's next **??**
- Second - and last - in-person Homebrew
  - Was a nice time with Carol
  - Made some very good progress on the scripts to convert my backfilled Twitter data to a format that my site can take. Still deciding whether I'll do it now, or once I've moved over to Vibrancy
- Got my headphones back from repair
- Had a nice unofficial Homebrew on Sunday - Anna and Carol had an in-person Tech Nottingham **??**
- Started work on my first _real_ monorepo - rather than a multi-module Java project - **??**
- Disappointed with Black Friday, but got some bits for the new living room
- Morph stressed sunday - other cat yowl, not settling
- Nottingham got the Omicron **??**
- Very excited to finally get my new laptop - an XPS 13 (9305)
- New laptop!
  - Arch Wiki progress
  - setup fairly painless, aside from `RAID mode`
  - getting IntelliJ running and not being painful was really good
- A busier week ahead of Anna's parents coming for the evening - we planned to make the Normandy chicken, but got treated to Rakki Rakkas which was nice
- Sunday was a Normandy chicken day, as we opted for Chapati Junction instead of cooking on Saturday
- Severn Trent, despite saying they'd call me last week to talk about the implications of a water meter, have put me onto a water meter, without a call
- Got part of the way through upgrading my personal services to Spring Boot 2.6.0 before finding [a Spring Security tweak is required](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/pull/10553), or I'll need to workaround it locally

Watched:

- _The Expanse_
- _Red Notice_ which we thought was really good - aside from a few bits towards the end that needed quite a bit of suspension of disbelief
- _Tidying Up with Marie Kondo_
- _Hawkeye_
- _Marriage or Mortgage_
- _Dream Home Makeover_
- _Saturday NIght Live_
