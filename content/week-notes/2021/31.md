A busy week ahead of my family coming for the weekend

- Had a good catchup with Neeshu - really nice to see another friend in person!
- Spent some time investigating Spring Cloud Contract for some alternatives to internal tooling for contract testing, and am looking forward to getting something together over the coming weeks that we can start using
- Started on, and made some very good progress with, the Gherkin pretty-printer for Java that will then be consumed by Spotless
- Sleep - waking up on time?
- Had a good skip 10:10, talking about progression
