A busy week ahead of my family coming for the weekend

- Had a good catchup with Neeshu - really nice to see another friend in person!
- Spent some time investigating Spring Cloud Contract for some alternatives to internal tooling for contract testing, and am looking forward to getting something together over the coming weeks that we can start using
- Started on, and made some very good progress with, the Gherkin pretty-printer for Java that will then be consumed by Spotless
- I've woken up early a couple of days this week, which I think is a sign that I'm actually now used to the wake up time, and my body is now on a schedule, although it's annoyingly about half an hour before expected
- Had a good skip 10:10, talking about progression
- Proved that my internal 3 minute timer that I use for tea is actually real - I predicted the time a few seconds before the timer went off!
- Been getting some (eye watering) window quotes
- A very disappointing clean by the cleaners this week - lots of stuff not done, so pursuing alternatives
- Tail end of a three day weekend was very fun, and a nice respite
- Morph had a very awkward lunch squaring off against the ginger cat which seemed to want to come into the house - after some hissing and showing off, the ginger cat just sat down, with Morph having the high ground. Watched him later get crabby when it went to leave, and instead hid in a tree
- Had my first Kansas BBQ bites from KFC and absolutely loved them, and have since been craving them all week
