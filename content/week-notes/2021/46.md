- Got on top of my email by setting up folders, filters, and unsubscribing from a fair few things I never pay attention to
- Got the log burner quoted for and booked in which is exciting
- _The Design of Web APIs_ has been a good read so far, and I've found the API Goals Canvas method useful for planning out the upcoming API Catalogue/API Linting work
- Got some good work in the DSA this week - we finished work on the DSA Workbench, I joined in a meeting with an API vendor about Federated discovery, and spent a bit of time thinking about stuff before planning tomorrow
- [Really happy with my move to Neovim due to Firenvim](/mf2/2021/11/l2v6v/), although it's not been super perfect everywhere
- Got my [leaving gifts](/mf2/2021/11/rlxc6/)
- Had a good catchup with Jamie - both around Lambdas and generally - and wrote up my Lambda learnings
- Got Wiremock managed through Spotless, now, and it bumped me up to second contributor, looking at lines changed
- Got quite a few PRs raised for Vibrancy, with a little bit of a burst of energy, as I'm starting to think I'm going to try and get moved over by early next year, as I'm feeling a few pain points with my setup, and think starting somewhat fresh may help
- Started rereading _Tiamat's Wrath_
- On a whim, decided I'd put Morph's rat poo toy in an empty tissue box to see if he'd enjoy a challenge, and it kept him _very_ busy and entertained!
- Got a pretty high quote for the fence to be re-done, but fortunately Dad helped me put in a temporary fix for it
- Been running a bit low on spoons and sleep
- Did some tweaks on my Micropub client to, finally, make it easier to i.e. add multiple categories to a post, as that wasn't possible without Inspect Element
- Had Mum and Dad to stay over the weekend which was nice:
  - Made [Oven-Baked Normandy Chicken & Apple Casserole](https://www.gousto.co.uk/cookbook/recipes/oven-baked-normandy-chicken-apple-casserole) for Friday, and got a very nice Marakesh Express for Saturday
  - Had a very nice Brownie and Hazelnut milkshake from Homemade Cafe on Saturday lunch
  - Morph wasn't as happy about visitors as he has been in the past<span style="display: hidden">, especially with lots of walking around and people not settling</span>
    - Having Sunday to chill then left him very cuddly in the evening
  - Got the fence and spare security camera up, was good to make some progress through the list
  - <span style="display: none">Being asked "why would you have interest" on your credit card was a bit ðŸ˜¬</span>
- Had both of the festive McDonalds burgers
- Ahead of the various Black Friday sales, I've opted to get a John Lewis credit card - on recommendation from my parents - so we can get a good amount of points banked for vouchers, instead of necessarily using all our vouchers now
- Decided on the XPS 13 9305 (not 9310 or XPS 15) and am just waiting to see if there are better deals upcoming
- Been looking at getting a water meter to reduce costs
- <span style="display: none">A bit of a stressful evening for the TN gang, when they found Bitwarden had expired, and all their passwords were lost - fortunately they were able to export without paying, and then update the payment details to restore access</span>
- Got my headphone repair paid for, so hopefully they won't be back before long
- Played around with the C4 Model - after watching a talk with the GDS folks - for things ahead of Monday's planning session

Watched:

- _Atypical_
- _The Expanse_
- _Eurovision Song Contest The Story Of Fire Saga_
- _Blackfish_
- _Dream Home Makeover_
