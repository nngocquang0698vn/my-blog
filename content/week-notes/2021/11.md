A week off for my birthday week, which was fairly blue, and not nearly as productive as it should've been **??**.

- <span style="display: hidden">Had a pretty awful dream about someone's head being used as a chopping board</span>
- Jigsaw progress has been pretty limited **??**, and **??**. Morph's also been enjoying swiping portions of the jigsaw away **??**
- Carol and Thom moved in, and we gave them a hand with a few bits, and got a nice chance to look around the new digs!
  - While at the old house, had a nice little hello from a grey cat
- Got a new Fire Stick (so we have one for the exercise bike) and the new one is so much quicker to connect to the app as well as having the remote
- Although I'd managed to get my mind off work by last Sunday, it then came back pretty hard towards the end of the week, and today **??**
- On Saturday I found that the loud fans in my office hasn't been the NAS, it was my Mac
- I've decided I prefer milk chocolate Lindt to dark chocolate
- Got burned by the Papa John menu design on Deliveroo, and accidentally got small pizzas - not the best use of the money :emb:
- May have caramelised one of our Gousto sauces this week by accident
- Ring Fit - stamina set
- Played a fair bit of Apex Legends as an alternative to deciding what to do
- Got my OBS setup sorted for my TN talk, but not done too much apart from that
- Had some lovely presents **??**
- Lego

Watched:

- (A lot of) _Suits_
- _Friday Night Dinner_
- _The Falcon and the Winter Soldier_
- _Bring It On_
- _Assembled: The Making of WandaVision_
- _Pitch Perfect_
- Got about an hour into _Once Upon a Time in Hollywood_ but gave up as it was painful to watch - not a good choice for my birthday!
