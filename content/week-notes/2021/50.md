A few days off work of not feeling great, wondering if it's Omicron as symptoms match, even though we're getting negative tests:

- Anna's had a much worse time of it this week so has been off for the week, so been doing a bit more of the cooking
- A really great GraphQL meetup at work - definitely sad that there have been a few usecases that I could've utilised it for - especially some of the previous APIs I've worked on. Definitely energised me a little and made me wonder if I can get it into anything I'm working on
- Started migration of meetup-mf2 to GraphQL, but need to get on Granary for Bridgy
- Morph's claws are getting very long - the other day we were playing, and his claw got stuck and it was quite difficult to hold him in place to get it unhooked, and he seemed a little stressed
- Morph's definitely been having a bad time this week, making things a little more stressful than they need to be
- Had some good catchups with friends
- No luck with Vibrancy, as I've not had a lot of energy
- Had a lovely Saturday together:
  - I played _Little Misfortune_ after Anna had her runthrough and I managed to get just one sparkle shy of the "good" ending
  - Built our Legos that we've been saving up
  - Ordered quite a few more custom Brickheadz - may have gone a little overboard, but excited to have quite a few new things coming soon
  - Had a lot of good food - was very good to know that Wandering Dragon is still especially good, albeit we didn't have it on my appendixaversary
- As a trial ahead of doing one for Anna's family over Christmas, [we made a ham in the Ninja Foodi](https://media.jvt.me/9663f62c37.jpeg). Was super easy - ~15 minutes pressure cooking, and ~5 minutes in the air fryer with marmalade to glaze it - and it's very tasty. Definitely bringing back good memories of all the ham from last Xmas, and I'm making my way through it quite quickly!
- A very disturbed night's sleep on Tuesday, and a mix of good and bad sleep throughout the week. With not sleeping well, and not feeling well too, lots of extra tiredness this week. Ended up sleeping in a bit more than I should be - at least according to the sleep regimen
- Saw a reddit thread talking about deviated septums, and how much of a difference it has made for a lot of people to have it sorted - wondering if maybe I get it sorted and it could improve sleep/snoring
- Had a lovely Basque burned cheesecake courtesy of Carol
- Carol and Thom got doggo!! Definitely feels like we've got a doggo too
- Bit annoying that Christmas plans are still slightly up in the air
