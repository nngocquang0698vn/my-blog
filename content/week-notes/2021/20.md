A week of some not great sleep, busy CV writing, and a very social weekend ending exhausted:

- Made some very good progress on `hire.jvt.me`, and think it'll be ready by Tuesday
- A weekend seeing Anna's family, which was nice, but quite a shock to the system having a weekend of seeing people, and hosting
  - Morph, obviously, wasn't happy with it either and made it very known!
  - But he also was very cute after everyone's left, and has been extra snuggly
- Managed to get secrets read/write working on my new Kubernetes setup, but race conditions are leading to refresh tokens getting lost - also still got issues with the post-deploy setup trying to hit the same pages multiple times, so am looking at rebuilding it to use ActiveMQ, which will hopefully deal with it a bit better
- Managed to get the spare bed ordered, and partially delivered, although the spare room isn't yet painted
- Had some good sessions looking at the code review from last sprint
- Opposite's cat came into the garden and was just _so cute_, but I may have encouraged it too much as its cute little face kept trying to come in ����
- Anna got her first vaccine! Didn't manage to get mine while we were there, but it's really starting to all come together!
- Some fun new stuff broken in the house - leaky bathroom tap and the curtain pull cord
- Started some progress on sharing out the structured logging work, and making improvements on our prod support docs
- Made an imitation KFC Gravy Burger with leftover roast chicken which was a poor imitation, but still good!
