"Sometimes you get the giraffe, sometimes you get the wig"

- My first week notes using Micropub!
  - It's pretty cool to be able to publish these at any point now, updating them more easily using Micropub than being required to do it on my desktop/laptop. It's generally how it will be done, but right now this sentence is being written between games of Apex on Windows, which is pretty great.
  - Took a bit of wrangling, and a few precursor pieces to get it set up, but I'm liking the ability to start writing articles on here, even if it's just Week Notes supported for now - the majority of the work is already done!
  - Had a few integration issues, which led to a kinda stressful Friday night getting them sorted, as I wanted to go downstairs and enjoy the new Mario game, but also wanted this kinda sorted, so I could start writing them if I wanted
- Been spending the week being excited for Mario 3D World (as something different to do, and cause I love Mario games) and have been really enjoying it so far. Especially loving the fact that I can play as a cat! 
- Everything has seemed a little more difficult this week life wise, and rethinking priorities re house / income
- Trialed reusing a teabag for tea on Saturday, as we were only having small mugs - turns out it doesn't work, so isn't ever gonna be a good cost saving measure ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

- A nice weekend of _Superstore_, Mario 3D World, and sofa snuggles
  - Morph spent Saturday morning exploring [the windowsill, from the outside](/mf2/2021/02/pugcw/)
  - He's also been snuggling under the sofa 
- Tried Ohanne's for the first time, which was pretty good - although it arrived just as I was playing my first game of Apex of the day, and threw the game despite being in the final two
- Got a really nice handmade card today
- Got `draft` scope and `post-status` implemented this week, which is useful for my week notes!
- Been supporting with the proxy pattern integrations for some of our existing services in the goal team which seem to have gone well
- A fairly hands off week again, so been doing a bit of multitasking
- Weirdly this week I've been remembering my dreams a lot better - I've been Bond, doing something with tokens, I've been in the Capitol, and I've been dreaming about Micropub for syndication
- Spoke about logging at the CoP which was good, and hoping to get more consumers for pickle-logs
