- My first week notes using Micropub!
  - It's pretty cool to be able to publish these at any point now, updating them more easily using Micropub than being required to do it on my desktop/laptop. It's generally how it will be done, but right now this sentence is being written between games of Apex on Windows, which is pretty great.
  - Took a bit of wrangling, and a few precursor pieces to get it set up, but I'm liking the ability to start writing articles on here, even if it's just Week Notes supported for now - the majority of the work is already done!
  - Had a few integration issues, which led to a kinda stressful Friday night getting them sorted, as I wanted to go downstairs and enjoy the new Mario game, but also wanted this kinda sorted, so I could start writing them if I wanted
- Been spending the week being excited for Mario 3D World (as something different to do, and cause I love Mario games) and have been really enjoying it so far. Especially loving the fact that I can play as a cat! 
- Everything has seemed a little more difficult this week life wise, and rethinking priorities re house / income
