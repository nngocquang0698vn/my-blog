A very social week, and my first five day week since July:

- (Most of) Purple Pandas returned for their first day in the office:
  - There was some really great energy in the office - it felt really lively, and kinda like first day back at uni, with everyone being excited to catch up
  - I mistimed the commute, so was running a little late, but managed to shave 10 minutes off the expected time from Google so I was happy with that
  - Seating positions in E@T are a little odd - as there's only 2 people to a 6 person table - but with social distancing it makes sense
  - Had a nice team breakfast, although it was a bit odd not being able to sit together, and it was a shame that it wasn't pancake day
  - With lunch not being as social, seating wise, we ate quicker than usual, and then had a nice walk out - was good to chat with a few people more casually, and I feel it opened us up to better conversations
  - Had a pretty good first handover for production support - ended up being 90 minutes of me speaking mostly non-stop, but was really great and the energy and presence of the team was good
  - Spent some of the day chatting to people - in and out of team - but also spent a bit of time with headphones on getting stuff done, but having the option to tap out and join conversations happening around me which was nice
  - I think we got an alright balance between Slack and in-person conversations, and the impromptu handover meeting was still remote friendly, which was great - but need to keep on it
  - Not enjoying the needing to book hubs/meeting rooms, it's such a shock to the system after so long of being able to just meet
  - It was a bit difficult with masks - although I'd started in one, between my desk and everywhere else, it got too difficult to keep doing it, so I stopped part way through the day. Going to see how I feel over time, and depending on how much I'm in the office, and how safe I feel, I'll switch it up
  - I'm excited to go back in again on Tuesday!
- Was nice to have Carol and Helen over on Wednesday evening
  - After not seeing Morph for a while, I tracked him down to being on the bed in the loft, having the best time, being super toasty and sleepy
- All day agile training on flow on Thursday was interesting, but after a day of socialising and being a human in public, I wasn't quite as switched on as it could be
- Had a spicy end to the week with my [/salary/](/salary/) page - it's sparked a lot of good conversations, had some lovely engagement on Twitter and LinkedIn, and quite a few DMs from people about it
- Carol's leaving do was good - was nice to be back to seeing people again
  - Lots of rain led to us moving inside - I wasn't quite sure I was ready for it, but it seemed OK, and Canal House is quite airy
  - Felt like the salary post may have overshadowed a little bit
- Anna and I met Carol for lunch on Friday at Homemade which was lovely - a nice way to end the week, and a bit more normalcy
- Saw Emma, Andrew and Flora for the first time - really nice to see their new home, but more the little teeny tiny human!!
- Quite a few bits around the house:
  - Got the cameras up
  - Got the locksmith coming this week
  - Managed to get the windows people in on Friday, and due to some misunderstandings, it was not to quote.. Fortunately I've got a personal email and hopefully will get a realistic quote soon
  - Made some good progress on sorting the garage
  - Got a cleaner which will hopefully be a regular occurrence
- After months of not helping, I've deciedd I'm going to no longer co-organise PHPMiNDS - it's been quite some time of me not helping, and the team are doing great without me, so instead of having the guilt of not helping, I'll step away
- Made good progress on ephemeral PRs for EZ, which if it works, will hopefully reduce a lot of pain for teams
- Ordered another very large box of Reese's 😂
- Didn't get to see Charles, but hoping to see him soon
- Was very excited to release v1.0.0 of [my Gherkin formatter](/posts/2021/09/07/gherkin-java-formatter/), before realising that actually, it still doesn't work because comments are very hard. Annoying, and means I'm still not quite ready to get my Spotless PR in
- Discovered Poppets in Lidl - very much enjoyed the dark chocolate + mint combo
- Suffered GitLab issues while trying to post this!
- Today is my five year anniversary at Capital One!

Watched:

- _Ugly Betty_ - it's aged fairly well, but the transphobia / non-inclusive language is a bit difficult
- _Downton Abbey_
- _What If?_
