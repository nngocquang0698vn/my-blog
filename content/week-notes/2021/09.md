- Had a productive 10% day working on fluentd configuration, and fighting regexes, but made some really awesome progress on simplifying logging for QTN

Watched:

- _Guns Akimbo_
- _What's Your Number?_
- _ What Happens in Vegas_
- _Superstore_ (which had been a really sad start to the last season!)
- _Sex Education_
