- My first Zoom funeral, which was sad, a bit weird not singing hymns, and having connection issues didn't help
- Got the windows people round to measure, but didn't get a chance to go check out the samples
- Had a productive 10% day working on fluentd configuration, and fighting regexes, but made some really awesome progress on providing structured logging, which will be hugely helpful for supportability
- Had some good time recharging on Saturday
- Found that apparently there are some people who think that "men are a gender minority", and are expected to be invited to minority events, which gave us an infuriating chuckle
- A quiet Homebrew
- Added support for Micropub CRUD on my articles, which will be useful, even if it is just for updating syndication links
- Got my micropub.rocks setup working, and my first PR ready for reviews
- Telegraph delays led to ~1 week of mentions being sent a bit late, so syndicated tweets came late, but ðŸ¤·
- Asda delivery, obviously, came earlier than the 0800 delivery slot
- Temporarily lost the recycling bin
- Had a nice catch up with Neeshu
- Bought a new CPU, which is the first step to doing my TN talk, so you could say I'm super prepared ðŸ˜…
- Morph had a very stressful Friday/Saturday, with a tonne of cats trying to get into the house, but he then spent most of Saturday asleep with us so that was really nice, and we had a good recharging weekend
  - Morph just trotting over last night, and settling himself in the nook between the arm of the sofa and Anna was ðŸ˜»
- Chef pipelines are imminently ready, just been waiting on container tweaks, and it's given me a chance to chat to some folks about fixing some previously broken ChefSpec tests which is good
- Tech Con this week at work which had a good mix of talks - but has also given me a lot of talks to watch after the fact, as I had quite a few clashes
