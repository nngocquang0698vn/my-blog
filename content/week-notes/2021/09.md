- My first Zoom funeral
- Got the windows people round to measure
- Had a productive 10% day working on fluentd configuration, and fighting regexes, but made some really awesome progress on simplifying logging for QTN
- Had some good time recharging on Saturday
- Found that apparently there are some people who think that men are in the minority, and are expected to be invited to minority events
- A quiet Homebrew
- Added support for Micropub CRUD on my articles
- Got my micropub.rocks setup working, and my first PR ready for reviews
- Telegraph delays led to ~1 week of mentions being sent a bit late, so syndicated tweets came late, but :shrug:
- Asda delivery, obviously, came early for an 0800 delivery

Watched:

- _Guns Akimbo_
- _What's Your Number?_
- _ What Happens in Vegas_
- _Superstore_ (which had been a really sad start to the last season!)
- _Sex Education_
