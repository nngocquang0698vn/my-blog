- My first Zoom funeral
- Got the windows people round to measure
- Had a productive 10% day working on fluentd configuration, and fighting regexes, but made some really awesome progress on simplifying logging for QTN
- Had some good time recharging on Saturday
- Found that apparently there are some people who think that men are in the minority, and are expected to be invited to minority events, which gave us an infuriating chuckle
- A quiet Homebrew
- Added support for Micropub CRUD on my articles
- Got my micropub.rocks setup working, and my first PR ready for reviews
- Telegraph delays led to ~1 week of mentions being sent a bit late, so syndicated tweets came late, but :shrug:
- Asda delivery, obviously, came earlier than the 0800 delivery slot
- Temporarily lost the recycling bin
- Morph had a very stressful Friday/Saturday, with a tonne of cats trying to get into the house
- Had a nice catch up with Neeshu

Watched:

- _Guns Akimbo_
- _What's Your Number?_
- _ What Happens in Vegas_
- _Superstore_ (which had been a really sad start to the last season, and hasn't been as good unfortunately)
- _Sex Education_
- _Bad Moms_
- _John Tucker Must Die_
- _What to Expect When You're Expecting_ in solidarity for our wonderful friends who've had exciting news this week
- _WandaVision_ finished this week with a very good episode
