A fairly busy week ahead of Rich and Soph staying, and API Days London for my second week at the DSA:

- Finally had a look at my money, and it's been interesting seeing what a number of upcoming big expenses actually mean
- Finished _Broken Sword 5: The Serpent's Curse_
- Was able to attend some of API Days London, which had some good sessions - some interesting things to think about and look into further
  - I ended up losing my notes from most of Thursday, which was not great.. Fortunately sessions are recorded and I'd planned to rewatch some of them
  - Felt very much called out by comments about poorly designed distributed monoliths<span style="display: none">and the way I've helped build them in the past</span>
- New Android 12 upgrade is taking a bit of time to get used to
- Became a maintainer of the Jenkins Job DSL plugin
  - Probably should've stepped up while I was still very actively using it, but am hoping that this will help others get continued use out of it
  - Nice to get my PR from last year's Hacktoberfest for credentials on folders released
  - Messed up the API viewer so needed to rush a follow-up release
  - Been a bit distracting with that happening around work
- Some of the stuff that I was working on in my last year at C1 is now imminently going live, which is awesome
- Got the final measurements for the windows, which should be all ready to go - just as soon as the materials are ready
- Got a couple of blog posts out that I'd been wanting to for a while, and a few blogumentations that weren't planned!
- Bought _The Design of Web APIs_, but haven't gotten around
- Finally getting around to talking to my potential therapist, who's now busy, so back to the drawing board
- Decided I'm getting an XPS 13 in Black Friday - found the configuration I want, and hoping that it'll be sufficiently reduced that it'll be worth waiting until then
- Another week of Morph being fairly stressed
- Had a lovely weekend hosting Rich and Soph
  - Had a few things to do ahead of them coming, so fairly busy prepping
  - Was really nice having them as our first non-family visitors
  - Really lovely to catch up with them
  - Did the [Lego jigsaw](https://media.jvt.me/0b3e07194a.jpeg)
  - Reminisced about the good - and not so good - old days
  - Had some very adult conversations about jobs, finances, what we want out of our lives
  - Had some good food, good chats, good wine, spirits and port, and a couple of late nights chatting
- Rediscovered some very nice photos from the last few years - for our digital photo frame - and have a new phone background, that I'm going to be getting printed for my desk
- Found it very frustrating not being able to join work meetings on Teams due to [Microsoft actively blocking Firefox](https://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/qa2crf/if_for_some_reason_you_want_to_use_ms_teams_via)
- Was nice having an extra hour's sleep this morning given the clocks changing
- <span style="display: none">Mum's antibody test came back very positive and full of antibodies!</span>
- Morph scared off a black cat trying to sneak into the garden
- Was a human adult and didn't get an unnecessary takeaway for Wednesday lunch
- Didn't get any trick or treaters, luckily
- Ordered my Hacktoberfest t-shirt
- Booper for the garage has stopped working, which is not great

Watched:

- _Atypical_
- _Space Force_
