- Been a bit better at leaving early this week, which has been nice to have a better balance
- Finished the Apex Legends hunts, and am very excited for the new season
- 10% time returned this week, and made some good progress on tweaking the way our Acceptance Tests run
- Had a really great Tech Nottingham on Monday
  - A great - and disheartening - look at the state of (Internet of Things) software
  - The return of Andrew as the quizmaster was amazing, and it was performed so well with the virtual setup, it felt like I was back at Hack24!
  - Event ended a bit late, and then Morph / cooking dampened the evening
- Enjoyed watching Morph scare away a black cat sitting under a car in front of the house on Monday
- We had a new team member join, and it's nice to have someone new with us
- Did some prefactoring on a shared codebase to make things easier for team members working on some innersourcing, but had a lot of pain getting Maven running both JUnit4 + JUnit5, as I didn't make it clear enough in [my blog post about it](/posts/2019/12/23/junit4-junit5-gotcha-together-maven/) - I've now updated it to save the next person looking into it
- Escape room didn't happen this week - may have been that I didn't have it correctly in the calendar
- Morph came in one morning with a claw coming out of his cheek - which seems like it was from a fight - but he seemed not bothered by it at all, and we've made sure it's alright
- Ring Fit Adventures this week didn't go so well - late nights and low motivation meant I didn't do as much
  - On Saturday I updated the difficulty level, but accidentally changed it from 11 to 22 (out of 30 total) which was **not OK**. Having to do a leg-heavy level absolutely killed me, but Anna cheered me on, and I was then able to bring it down to a more respectable level
- Learned about the [&lt;datalist&gt;](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/datalist) HTML5 element (but I'd love to have a multi-select ability)
- Yet again found that [Smoky Spanish Chicken, Patatas Bravas & Aioli](https://www.gousto.co.uk/cookbook/chicken-recipes/smoky-spanish-chicken-patatas-bravas-aioli) is an amazing recipe
- Sad to not have Rich and Sophie's wedding yesterday
- Was able to grab some old Slack conversations that may come in handy in the future
- Finally got around to our last Easter Egg
- Sunday afternoon stroll with Anna, and some good chats
- Gave up re-enabling my post-deploy Webhooks regularly and [reached out to Netlify about webhook issues](https://community.netlify.com/t/webhooks-deploy-notiifcations-being-disabled-due-to-non-200s)
- Been making more progress on the Micropub refactor, but it's going to be a mega-MR, and I wish I had a slightly better way to build it in, slowly
- Got _Paper Mario_ which I've been enjoying - art style, humour, and gameplay!
- Been finding my infinity cube really useful, and it's making a big difference with fidgeting when doing things! Although unfortunately it is pretty loud
- Almost finished _Modern Family_ on Netflix
- Watched _Disclosure_
- Watched _Code 8_
- Watched _Late Night_
- Watched _Black Panther_
- Really need to get my hair cut!
- [The tribe promotion announcements were good fun](/posts/2020/07/15/capital-one-promotion-celebration/), and I really enjoyed Chris' speech for me
