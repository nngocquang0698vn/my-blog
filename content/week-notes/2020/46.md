A busy meetup week, ending in Diwali and New Year:

- Been using Milk and More a bit more this week, and are liking that it means we don't have to go shopping (as much)
- A quiet Homebrew, but had a great catch-up with Bal
- First team retro - some good learnings, and some good actions. Again, really happy with the team's progress, and looking forward to stretching ourselves a little more this sprint
- Spoke at the QE CoP about shifting testing left, which will result in a blog post hopefully this coming week with some of the good Spring Boot tips I've got
- Had a good review of my end-of-year self review, recapping what's been a great year, had some really nice personal feedback, and looking forward to the next year!
- Didn't really do 10% on Friday, but spent the time doing other things and supporting others which was nice
- Only one Ring Fit this week on Friday, and then got a bit of exercise this weekend with the shopping, and packing, so not as bad as previous weeks
- Making somewhat good process for packing, although there's still a tonne left
- Had a leaflet through the door about how Coronavirus is a conspiracy and related to 5G - was half tempted to shout down the street at whoever had put it through the letterbox
- Morph did not enjoy me attaching mousey to his paw, and had a bit of an "oh god why is it following me" moment, which I felt a little bad for, although it was funny
- Watched the first few episodes of the new _Star Trek: Discovery_ season
- Watched season 1 of _Jack Ryan_ and half of season 2 this weekend
- Listened to the latest _Late Night Linux_
- Listened to [_What's new with OAuth2.1_](https://auth0.com/resources/podcasts/S1E002IDUnlocked)
- Tried out Chapatti Junction and had a pretty good meal, although the mango lassi wasn't nearly as good as Rickshaw's
- Had a Rickshaw for Diwali, and a bit of a chat with the family - it was weird not being in person, and it being the first year without Kaki
- Spoke to Chris about long-term impacts he's feeling
- Going to start on _The Churn_ before I get stuck into _Babylon's Ashes_
- Had a really nice Sunday on the sofa, watching _Jack Ryan_ and generally spending time together, although we possibly could've got a bit more packing done!
- Tweaked my week notes' URL structure so they're now i.e. `/2020/46/` for the 46th notes this year
- Making some really good progress on my IndieAuth server - had my first end-to-end authorization grant and use of token, although still only locally as there's a few things I want to get implemented before it goes to my staging site.
- Unfortunately the house has progressed nowhere this last week, despite having the searches back, due to enquiries being open with the vendors, so unfortunately we don't yet have a date to work to for exchange
- Heard some pretty great news about (that company)
- Still haven't done my laptop
