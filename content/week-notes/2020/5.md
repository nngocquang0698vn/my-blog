A week back at work following [a week of holiday](/week-notes/2020/4/), in which I:

- caught up on where the team was around eIDAS delivery
- carried on my trend of waking up earlier, trying to get my body into a routine that starts earlier in the day so I can shift my working day a bit earlier, or move to a 9 day fortnight
- continued reading before bed as part of the wind down, this time continuing on from _Thrawn_ and reading [Thrawn: Alliances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_Thrawn#Thrawn:_Alliances)
- spent a very frustrating Sunday fighting my Webmentions not sending due to, most likely, an upgrade to Spring Boot on my post-deploy project, which resulted in Jackson not parsing the sitemap correctly. However it was fixed with thanks to [the `xjc` command](/posts/2020/02/03/generate-pojo-xml-xsd/)
- watched the finale of _The Good Place_, which was emotional and a lovely end to the series
- did not attend FOSDEM, as I decided that [after last year not being as good as the last year I went]({{< ref 2019-02-09-fosdem-2019 >}}) I wouldn't go, but would instead catch up on talks afterwards
- worked a fair bit on [meetup-mf2](https://gitlab.com/jamietanna/meetup-mf2/)
  - was able to start integrating Aperture with meetup-mf2 as <span class="h-card"><a class="u-url p-name" href="https://aaronparecki.com">Aaron</a></span> merged [support for parsing MF2 JSON in XRay and Aperture](https://github.com/aaronpk/XRay/pull/94)
  - this uncovered an issue with the data I was returning, which I then resolved (and subsequently broke my Micropub endpoint)
  - adding caching for the response from Meetup.com to reduce the calls, especially when being refreshed from Aperture every x minutes
  - added author information to the response, to provide better information in feeds
- did not attend the two meetups I'd planned to - because I was pretty tired, and didn't want to push myself to meetups I wouldn't necessarily engage with / enjoy
- still haven't booked any driving lessons
- watched [Mile 22](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4560436/), which has been on my list for a while, and enjoyed it
- started watching [Money Heist](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6468322/), which has been on the Netflix list for a while, and am not sure if I enjoy it yet
- replaced Pushbullet with Pushover, which has been a much better experience so far in terms of the number of push notifications I've received for syndicated content
- had some good pairing on some CLI work with a colleague
- received the details about my end of year bonus / pay rise - to which my reaction was [the song _Just Got Paid_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUJGwSy0pRI)
- did not get around to continuing on [Meetup.com support for Brid.gy](https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/pull/906)
- [added support](/mf2/2020/02/kaefh/) for embedding like/reply/repost-context for interactions with Twitter on this site
- helped Anna with [her applications for a new job at the DVSA](https://annadodson.co.uk/blog/2020/04/06/new-job/)
- had an exciting shopping trip

And, unfortunately, the United Kingdom left the EU - [#brexshit](/tags/brexshit/).
