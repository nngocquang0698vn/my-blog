I'm posting this a little bit early, as tomorrow I'm off to Tenerife with my family. This week was super duper busy, and I'm pretty glad it's over:

- It was meetup week:
  - [Tech Nottingham on Monday](/mf2/2019/12/nvadh/) - I'm yet to write up my notes
  - [NottsJS on Tuesday](/mf2/2020/01/kkdvk/)
  - Notts IoT on Wednesday - but I didn't go, as I needed a day off to try and get some packing done
  - [PHPMiNDS on Thursday](/mf2/2020/01/ahdiq/)
- Preparing for holiday, so bits of packing and sorting stuff at home, but looking forward to a week away in Tenerife
- At work:
  - Finalised this PI's workload, which I'm fairly happy with
  - Had some good pairing with a colleague on some shell scripting to automate OpenSSL + certificate chain creation
  - Had a really positive End of Year appraisal - I'm in a good place for hopeful progression this year, and I know what I need to do to succeed
  - Presented my first piece of work at Technical Design Review at work
  - Performed first production release with new CI/CD setup, and aside from a minor change for the Production-only pipeline, everything worked awesomely
  - Lots of competing priorities, and lots that needed to be done before I left for Tenerife
- Didn't get a chance to work on Brid.gy Meetup support
- On this site:
  - Added the rewriting of Twitter usernames to `@username` for easier Twitter syndication i.e. [/mf2/2020/01/ri7lj/](/mf2/2020/01/ri7lj/)
  - Realised I'm now hitting the limits of Pushbullet API access - [/mf2/2020/01/yelaf/](/mf2/2020/01/yelaf/)
  - Added the rewriting of `#HashTags` to a tag on the content for `hash-tag`, allowing me to own my hashtags, too
  - Interacted a lot with folks on Twitter using this site + Brid.gy syndication
- Back to Gousto this week, but unfortunately found that with meetup week (which was busier than planned, especially with PHPMiNDS moving a week behind) we only got round to 2/3 meals by tonight - not great! Hopefully when I'm back we'll be better at it.
