A very long week, with lots more overworking than I should have:

- Monday was a great start to the week - I started the day off with some yoga, I had a productive day, and then while Anna was on a Tech Nottingham call I did the food shop, cleaned the kitchen, prepped fruit for breakfasts and cooked dinner - and got to bed at a reasonable time!
- Tuesday started the downhill trend - no yoga, difficult to get up in the morning, and late to bed
- Got my form in for mid-year, so ðŸ¤ž it'll be good news
- Wednesday I spent some time setting up a GitLab CI shell executor, to look to migrate my site's deploys from Netlify's build system [costing a lot](/posts/2020/05/27/migrate-netlify-deploy-gitlab/)
- After complaining (in my head) at Netlify hitting weird errors on post-deploy [which I had already fixed](https://gitlab.com/jamietanna/www-api/-/merge_requests/159) I realised [I had missed a codepath](https://gitlab.com/jamietanna/www-api/-/merge_requests/161)
- Had a lot of things go wrong at work on Thursday - a sign that I'm juggling too much, and that I need more of a break
- Had some good drive to improve shared library usage internally - creating a couple of good cross-cutting ones, and with a few more on the horizon. Felt productive, and glad we can start to remove some of the duplication
- Worked through Women in Tech on Thursday, as I got quite into some refactoring at work for adding in OpenID Connect Discovery as part of our End-to-End testing, which luckily was a good time to deliver it
  - What I did attend of Denise's talk was very good, and I'm sad I missed it
  - Bit burned out after the event (and very long day), so needed some quiet, but joined Anna for a chat with Emma and Andrew which was nice
- [Ordered a new desk chair](https://www.jvt.me/mf2/2020/06/my6gi/) which is very much required, and I'm really looking forward to
- I'm very much enjoying <span class="h-card"><a class="u-url p-name" href="https://christine.website/">Christine Dodrill</a></span>'s theme, and am most likely going to be redesigning my own site using [<i class="fa fa-github"></i> egoist/hack](https://github.com/egoist/hack) very soon
- Friday night KFC failures, with frustrated calls to Uber Eats support to get the order cancelled - ended up getting a :yum: Rikshaw, but then remembered that the food I was looking forward to was actually Desi Downtown (which had plenty of delivery issues itself)
- Watched _The Lovebirds_
- Saturday was a lovely day just on laptops/the sofa, where we watched:
  - Watched _Let's Go To Prison_
  - Watched _Get Him to the Greek_
  - Watched _Get Hard_
  - Watched _When We First Met_
  - Watched _Jack Reacher: Never Go Back_
  - Got KFC - wasn't that impressed with the Zinger burger, so back to Fillet it is
- Had our first [mycookiedough](/posts/2020/06/07/review-mycookiedough-delivery/)
- Ending the weekend feeling pretty exhausted - it's been an emotionally big week (with sociopolitical factors increasing in intensity) - and maybe not quite ready for work again
- Hoping to book some time off soon for Anna's birthday, but also considering booking more Fridays off to help space out my time off - I've got a lot of holidays, and I think it'll be good to start with making me comfortable with the working pattern of maybe moving to a 9 day fortnight
- Weather not being very nice hasn't really helped - it's back to being cold and wet after a taste of warmth
- One of my blog posts from Wednesday got some hits on Saturday, which I'm quite happy with
- Because it's been quite busy, and I've not had much downtime, I've not done much _Apex Legends_ nor have I read that much this week
- Had a good chat about mental health with my sister
