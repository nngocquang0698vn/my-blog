Another week spent a little unattached at work, but slowly making my way to being so-very-close to having my Micropub server live.

- Pretty sure it's the CPU that was bust in my machine, as mid-week I was watching my analytics on my desktop, and it just died - so definitely not overheating / an issue under stress
- Had nice catchups with Rich and Sophie, and Cat this week
  - Rich got me thinking about whether I look at pursuing `tan.na` again
- Attended some of SpringOne, but unfortunately a lot of the talks I wanted to attend clashed with Homebrew/WiT, so I'm going to need to follow up with them
- Had a pretty successful week with my article, [_Why I Actively Discourage Online Tooling like `jwt.io` and Online JSON Validators_](/posts/2020/09/01/against-online-tooling/)
  - Was pretty happy that I wrote and posted it so quickly, as although I've spent a few days thinking about it, I pretty much just sat down and wrote it
  - I've had > 20000 hits that I've recorded on Matomo, which is probably a very small amount of the total views that I've had, due to readers most likely having ad-blockers
  - Was re-posted to Hacker News, which increased the viewer count considerably, but was annoying I lost out on a lot of HN karma
  - Had a somewhat mixed reception, but mostly positive, and didn't take the comments too personally
  - Was featured in:
    - the hackernewsletter
    - Tech Nottingham's newsletter
    - NodeWeekly
- Had my family up this weekend to visit the current house choice
  - was very happy that they enjoyed seeing it in-person, and after walking over, and seeing the trees and the nearby area
  - Had The Athenian for lunch, which was such a great choice, was really nice, and meant we didn't need to cook or do anything kitchen-based
  - Think I may have made my family's month as I gave them the first hug I'd been able to since early March. It was so nice, especially with such a momentous occasion, and I'm so glad I offered (quote from my mum - "it was the best moment of 2020" ðŸ¥º)
- Put in an offer for the house! ðŸ™€ðŸ¤ž
- Started reading _Cibola Burn_
- Had some more quite vivid dreams this week - one about visiting my old school again, and one where I moved into a team at work I wasn't expecting
- Supporting a new starter for my new team, which is exciting, although we don't have as much interesting things to work on quite now
- Turns out that telling Rikshaw to make sure the driver had everything before they deliver it actually worked!
- Had a lovely Sunday afternoon in the Arboretum with Carol, Thom, Emma and Andrew, chilling, having some awesome [BBQ brisket poutine, with smoked bacon](https://media.jvt.me/bd00f8951a.jpeg) (although it wasn't the fateful butter chicken poutine)
  - Was another lovely afternoon chilling, with a bit more normality
- Considering replacing Netlify for `media.jvt.me` with a GCP bucket, so it updates quicker, and doesn't have the problem of image size long-term
- My new team's (at least initial) work has been confirmed - will share more when I can
- Missed Monday's Ring Fit as I was super sore after the weekend, and Friday as I was pretty knackered after WiT, even though it wasn't _as_ late a night
- Enjoyed the strong start to _The Boys_
- Watched _Zodiac_ which was very good, especially as we didn't know what was going to happen
- Watched _Zoolander_
