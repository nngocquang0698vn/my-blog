Have any of my blog posts saved you time, and taught you some great time-saving tricks? Have they helped you close off that piece of work a little bit quicker, or made your tooling more secure?

Do you enjoy the IndieWeb-related contributions I create, or the services I run?

I'd appreciate if you paid it forwards by either contributing your own blogs to the world, or [supporting me on Buy Me a Coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/jamietanna) - you can also support me through [PayPal.me](https://paypal.me/jamiet) or [Monzo.me](https://monzo.me/jamesvivektanna/5).

I'm a huge fan of Gousto, and have [written about how much I enjoy it]({{< ref 2019-07-07-four-months-gousto >}}), and you may too - you can sign up with my [referral code `JAMIE21201650`](https://cook.gousto.co.uk/raf?promo_code=JAMIE21201650&utm_source=androidapp), which helps keep me health(ier) and benefits both of us!
