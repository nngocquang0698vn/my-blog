Have any of my blog posts saved you time, and taught you some great time-saving tricks? Have they helped you close off that piece of work a little bit quicker, or made your tooling more secure?

Do you enjoy the IndieWeb-related contributions I create, or the services I run?

I'd appreciate if you paid it forwards by either contributing your own blogs to the world, or [supporting me on Buy Me a Coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/jamietanna) - you can also support me through [PayPal.me](https://paypal.me/jamiet) or [Monzo.me](https://monzo.me/jamesvivektanna/5).
