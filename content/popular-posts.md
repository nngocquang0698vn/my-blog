I run analytics on this website which are quite useful for me, as I can find out which posts are doing well, as well as seeing over time what sort of interest I get for certain posts.

This data was intentionally not made available publicly - not least for data security reasons - but I've now written an intermediate layer that ensures that the data returned is anonymised.

You can see below some of the stats, which I'll be making more fully featured over time.
