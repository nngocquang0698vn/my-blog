## Commentary

2019 was the year of the IndieWeb for me. Although in 2018 I'd mentioned that [at Hackference 2018](https://www.jvt.me/posts/2018/12/09/hackference-2018/) I was looking to get involved, it wasn't until 2019 that I really got dug into it, and I spent a lot of time this year building IndieWeb technologies into my site.

The 46 posts that were tagged `www.jvt.me` were all around this site and improvements as such, as well as some that had `announcement`.

I also attended a tonne of events, and wrote write-ups for them which was a good way of solidifying the learnings as well as being something that others could read about.

And [I learned some stuff](https://www.jvt.me/posts/2019/11/30/nablopomo-2019-retro/) from doing National Blog Post Month (NaBloPoMo), which gave me a fair few extra posts.

I posted a few of my posts to Lobste.rs and got some good discusions going, especially for [Ditching Event Platforms for the IndieWeb](https://lobste.rs/s/f0nkok/ditching_event_platforms_for_indieweb).
