The Homebrew Website Club is a regular meeting for enthusiasts and hobbyist programmers who are building, or thinking of building, their personal websites. The meeting is an informal setting where you can talk with others, get inspiration, or quietly work on your site.

However, for the magic month of [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com), Homebrew Website Club Nottingham is having a Hacktoberfest takeover!

Come to meet to work on contributing (or learning how to get started with contributing) to Open Source software, others' websites, and hopefully get one Pull Request closer to a T-shirt of cosmic proportions!

Want to RSVP? [You can follow the steps in _How to RSVP to an Indie Event from your Website_]({{< ref "2019-08-21-rsvp-from-your-website" >}}).
