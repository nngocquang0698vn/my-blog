The Homebrew Website Club is a regular meeting for enthusiasts and hobbyist programmers who are building, or thinking of building, their personal websites. The meeting is an informal setting where you can talk with others, get inspiration, or quietly work on your site.

NOTE: This clashes [with the first meeting of Cyber Nottingham](https://www.meetup.com/Nottingham-Cyber-Capital-One/events/260280774/), which may mean that I'll be attending that instead of this event, but that doesn't mean you all shouldn't attend!
