The Homebrew Website Club is a regular meeting for enthusiasts and hobbyist programmers who are building, or thinking of building, their personal websites. The meeting is an informal setting where you can talk with others, get inspiration, or quietly work on your site.

Note that unlike [other Homebrew Website Clubs](https://indieweb.org/Homebrew_Website_Club), this does not have a strict schedule. Instead, we get together and work and/or chat about our sites.

Want to RSVP? [You can follow the steps in _How to RSVP to an Indie Event from your Website_]({{< ref "2019-08-21-rsvp-from-your-website" >}}).
