This is for a few reasons:\n\n- categories are not Microformats2 markup-able (as we can't distinguish between tags and categories, it's just `p-category` which we use for tags)\n- categories in the site are not currently hierarchical - although they may be defined as such, they're not presented like it\n- categories are not any more meaningful than tags, as they're almost always the same, or a reduced set, compared to the tags\n\nSo we may as well just remove support for them, as they serve exactly zero purpose.",
