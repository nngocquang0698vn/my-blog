description:
  You're writing Cucumber tests in your language of choice, but until you actually run that code against i.e. your API, you won't know if the functionality is correct. We're big proponents of Behaviour Driven Development and Test Driven Development, but why doesn't that extend to our functional testing using Cucumber?
  A practice used at Capital One in a number of teams is writing tests for your tests - that is, writing unit + integration tests for your Cucumber steps to provide greater confidence our functional tests.
  Although you may find that you can spin through your Cucumber tests pretty quickly, it may be that you need to take a step back and think about the quality behind the "quality" in "quality engineering".
