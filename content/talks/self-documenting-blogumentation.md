  Blogumentation is a term that I've coined around blogging as a form of documentation. Although started as a way to have a single place for little tips-and-tricks or common issues I was facing, it's become more widely known and used.
  Not only for helping myself remember facts, it's been a wealth of knowledge for my colleagues  at Capital One and through my site's analytics, I can tell it's quite popular outside of the business, too.
  I'll take you through some of the interesting learnings I've picked up through my journey, and how it's helped me change my approach to communication and documentation, and more importantly, will share some tips for you to get started and start building your personal brand!
