When running Jenkins' Multibranch pipelines, you get a handy environment variable `GIT_BRANCH` which tells you what the current branch is, so you can do different things in your pipeline.

However, when you're using a Pipeline Job, that's not possible, as the environment variable isn't set.

Fortunately, this is available to the Groovy sandbox, and as [Mad Physicist mentions on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/43786068), we can reference it using:

```groovy
scm.branches[0].name
```

This allows us to see which branch was used to check out the script that is currently executing.
