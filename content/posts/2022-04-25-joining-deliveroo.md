For those who didn't see, I [announced in early April](https://www.jvt.me/mf2/2022/04/vhdfr/) that I was leaving my role in Cabinet Office.

It wasn't an easy decision, as I had a good time there, and worked on some interesting things, and am really happy I was there to start off, and have an impact on a number of cross-government initiatives like the [Federated API Discovery Model](https://github.com/co-cddo/federated-api-model/) and improvements on the [API Catalogue](https://www.api.gov.uk), as well as looking at [API linting for government API standards](https://github.com/co-cddo/api-standards-linting) and being part of the cross-government Software Development community.

But today, I'm very excited to announce that I'm joining Deliveroo as a Senior Software Engineer, and it's my first day!

Deliveroo have a tonne of interesting problems to solve, at global scale, with some really excellent engineering talent, leadership and product folks. I'm looking forward to get stuck into thinking bigger than I have done previously in my career, building distributed systems that can scale well, and most importantly, give me the chance to work on a product I use... a lot üòÖ I feel this will be an even bigger motivator, and it'll be great to bring my passion for tasty food to everyone!

I'm also looking forward to owning production services again, as I've missed having the constant buzz of traffic and exploration of the system to guide what's next.

It's also my first fully remote job, so I'm looking forward to getting stuck into the remote lifestyle, which will make it easier with the new puppy [Cookie](/tags/cookie/).

It's going to be a bit of a shock to the system working at a higher pace, but I'm really excited for this next chapter in my career!

Deliveroo are hiring a lot of folks, let me know if you're interested in joining the team üòÅ Maybe my [/salary/ page](/salary/) can be another convincing factor!
