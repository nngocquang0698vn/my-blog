At [Monday's Tech Nottingham](https://www.technottingham.com/events/tech-nottingham-october-2021) it was Lightning Talks from the audience, which are always a fun night.

As I've recently [shared my salary publicly]({{< ref 2021-09-09-public-salary-history >}}), I thought it'd be good to talk about the things that have come out of it.

This is a (rough) writeup of what was said.

I started by sharing a link to [/salary/](/salary/) and giving a small overview of why I am sharing it.

# People enjoyed reading / talking about it

This overview gave me time to see that my website's analytics could see a handful of people going to the page to see my salary information. This segued quite nicely into the social media engagement that I'd had:

People have been really interested to hear about it, seeing progression, and I've seen much more traffic to the [/salary/](/salary/) page itself, compared to the blog post, showing people care about the numbers more.

# It's nice to be happy with what you've got... until you're not

Although I was really happy with the salary I was going onto at the Cabinet Office, I naturally had other folks mention that they were on more. It's one of those things that reminds me that I'm doing it for exactly that reason - in cases where people aren't talking about salaries, or aware what the market rate is for their skills, they'll find they're being underpaid.

I did also have at least two messages from folks who thought I'd be making more money, which isn't the compliment they thought!

# People don't like talking about it!

Salary is still one of those things that is deeply personal, and still feels like a very specific representation of your personal worth.

I found it interesting that even when I had shared my details so clearly, people direct messaging didn't want to share anything, and instead more give indications of whether it was similar / more.

I can see why folks wouldn't want to talk about it, and I hope that at least people will start to talk about it with their friends, and hopefully trusted colleagues.

# People were quite concerned about legality

Something that I'd definitely not considered before posting it was that it may not even be legal - I definitely should have checked that before I YOLO'd and did it.. Woops!

I knew that in the US there were some states/employers who were able to get it into contracts to prevent discussing it, but fortunately, after posting it, there were good discussions about the [Equality Act 2010](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/equality-act-2010-guidance) that it would protect discussions. Additionally, going into Civil Service, where things are very open, it wasn't that problematic.

# It was covered on a podcast!

It was pretty cool to hear about the thoughts of the [Tech Team Weekly podcast](https://www.techteamweekly.com/episode/5) on the post, and open salaries. I was on holiday when it landed and had to get away and listen to the section, just to make sure that nothing negative was being said about me / being inferred that could give bad optics to it. I had nothing to worry about in the end, but still thought it was good to be sure!

# Closing

I noted that I'm also planning on writing a post in a year to reflect on what happened, and hoping to look back and see some positive impact that has come from the post.

I've had a lot of people reach out to say thank you, a couple who've shared their own salary information for comparison, and at least one other person doing similar, which is great!
