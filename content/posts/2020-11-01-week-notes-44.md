A pretty alright week:

- Thoroughly enjoyed Sainsbury's Taste the Difference mince pies, and rate them as the best this year so far!
- Smashed a couple of big stories on day 1 of the sprint, and managed to get a fair bit of refactoring / cleanup done, so felt pretty happy with progress so far
- Took Thursday off as one of my "make sure you use your holiday before the end of the year" days
  - Didn't want to take off 10% day, and Thursday worked best
  - Got some stuff done around the house, and looking at some of the paperwork for the new house
  - Was a mostly screen-less day which was good
- Had a pretty weird dream about being back at uni, with a mix of friends from during and after uni, with a mix of Army life thrown in there. Very odd, and not quite sure why it's popped up!
- Had a bit of panic that y PC was having problems again, but it was just my displays not turning on for a BIOS screen
- A second lockdown was announced, which will introduce more restrictions, but generally we won't see too much of a change
- Got around to cooking the meatballs from the freezer, which were pretty good, and are gonna last us a few lunches
- Listened to some of the WiFi Wars gaming night at work after a quiet Homebrew, but was busy with things so didn't participate
- Got a Cote order and had [such a lovely Friday night](/mf2/2020/10/3b3s2/)
- Missed Ring Fit on Monday, and Wednesday/Friday were both quite small workouts, but hoping to get back into it a bit more this week
- Started getting my laptop ready to re-install [after saying I was going to almost two years ago]({{< ref 2018-12-22-leaving-btrfs >}})
- [Got around to another haircut](/mf2/2020/11/plyrn/)
- Managed to get to Level 100 in the _Apex Legends_ battle pass just in time for the end of the season
- Been super exciting for Cat moving into the bungalow
- Finished watching _I'll Be Gone in the Dark_
- Watched _Hocus Pocus_
- Watched _Zombieland_
- _Nemesis Games_ is getting really good - we're in for a great season
- Had some very sad family-related news
