[In April](https://gitlab.com/jamietanna/jvt.me/issues/448) I realised that my 404 page wasn't working on Netlify, which meant that when someone hit an invalid link on my site, they'd get a default Netlify error page, rather than anything branded on my site.

Now, I make a large amount of effort to make sure that my site never returns a 404 - I verify that my blog posts always stick around (as I receive a lot of traffic from external sources) as well as performing HTMLProofer checks on the site to verify that anything I've personally linked in the site resolves correctly.

I used <span class="h-card"><a class="u-url" href="https://annadodson.co.uk">Anna</a></span>'s awesome post [Custom 404 page in Hugo on Netlify](https://annadodson.co.uk/blog/2019/09/07/custom-404/) to get this working - plus adding a custom content page [/404/](/404/).
