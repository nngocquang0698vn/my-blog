As I've been getting involved with the [#IndieWeb](/tags/indieweb/), I've been starting to find other communities on the Web who are building upon new standards.

One of these communities I found a while back was the [Now Movement](https://nownownow.com/about), from <span class="h-card"><a class="p-name u-url" href="https://sivers.org">Derek Sivers</a></span>'s post [_The /now page movement_](https://sivers.org/nowff).

The movement is all about having a page /now (of which the name doesn't have to be /now) which records what currently interests you and your focus is. It's meant to be continually updated, and the sort of info:

> Think of **what youâ€™d tell a friend you hadn't seen in a year.**

I've replaced my /about page with [/now](/now/) because /about was quite static, and hopefully this will help me keep it updated.
