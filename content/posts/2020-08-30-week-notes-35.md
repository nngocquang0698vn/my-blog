The best way to sum up this week is _a slump_, despite being a 4 day week.

- As I didn't have my desktop, I spent Monday evening doing some slow blogumentation while watching South Park and _Sausage Party_ which was nice, but I feel it would've been nicer on my desktop
- Oddly was able to remember my dreams this week, most of which were weird
- Managed to hurt my foot quite a bit - I think maybe two days solid at my standing desk and I don't think my feet are used to it
- Wondering if my posture is less than ideal when standing
- Had a great second viewing of "the" current house I'm looking at buying. Feeling really positive, but had a very not-positive conversation after with the family
- Had a lovely Friday with Anna's family for her dad's birthday
  - We had our first inside meal which felt mostly like normal, although it was surprising how few of the staff were wearing masks
  - Little Klara was the cutest!
- Finally got my PC working on Saturday, which may have actually been the motherboard after all, and means I didn't need to buy a new PSU, either
  - Realised that the reason the new CPU didn't work is that it was overheating, so that probably didn't help with my diagnosis
  - Going to monitor it over this coming week, then start returning/selling extras
  - Definitely feeling much happier now it's back up and running
- Had a great time sleeping over at Emma and Andrew's on Saturday
  - Had such a lovely time - was nice to see them, and was wonderfully like normal again
  - Played _Pistol Whip_ for the first time, and really enjoyed it, although I didn't quite get the timing right! It also managed to work a lot of muscles I don't exercise with Ring Fit, so I'm very sore today!
  - Got my slow-mo on for _Superhot VR_
  - Got a bit too engrossed in VR and [fell on my pudding](https://media.jvt.me/ffeb8d4723.jpeg)
  - Morph seemed to be happy with us being away, hopefully he'll be able to cope with us doing it more in the future
  - _That_ conversation came up again, and brought with it the feelings of everything that happened, and what I should've done
  - Had a happy, somewhat hungover, Sunday gaming which was nice again
- Had first KFC in a while
- Had a super fun time with a recent update to Fire TV which caused the audio to be massively out of sync until we changed the default audio settings
- Been seriously contemplating making my site dynamically rendered, with the same flat files in the backend
- Hasn't been a great week health wise - only done 2/3 Ring Fit sessions, and eating a lot more chocolate than I really should have
- Watched _Sausage Party_
- Watched _Bridesmaids_
- Watched _Now You See Me_
- Regretfully watched _Now You See Me 2_
- Partially watched _The Invention of Lying_
