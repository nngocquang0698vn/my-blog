Another long week, doing a lot more overworking than I should have:

- As I worked over a lot, it meant I didn't have a lot of time for personal projects / relaxation, so I ended up working on personal things until late, getting to bed late, and then waking up super tired
- Lots of things breaking at work, and feeling like I had to pick up a fair bit of slack - not that this is necessarily true, but that's how I've been feeling
- [Overhauled my site's theme]({{< ref 2020-06-11-new-css-who-dis >}})
- Busy meetup week, with Tech Nottingham, Homebrew Website Club Nottingham and PHPMiNDS
- New mattress arrived this week! We got the Eve Premium Mattress, and so far it's been making a pretty big difference with sleep - although I didn't get them to pick up the old mattress, so that's in the way a bit
- Watched _Artemis Fowl_, but [was not happy](/mf2/2020/06/ynd3o/) with how it was written
- Started watching _Alex Rider_ which I am really impressed with - it's been a great adaptation so far (two episodes in)
- Watched _The Family_
- Watched _One For The Money_
- Spent a fair bit of time fighting Google Cloud Functions as part of setting up the [jwks-ical API]({{< ref 2020-06-14-track-certificate-expiry-jwks-ical >}})
  - Wanted to use GCP as I've still got a tonne of credit left, and it's nice to have alternatives in my toolchain
  - Mostly had issues around JDK11 build/uploads
  - But I'm quite impressed with the way the Java API bindings are written, and the ease I could get it working
  - Was a bit disappointed I couldn't set up a custom DNS record, and even through Firebase I didn't manage to get it working
