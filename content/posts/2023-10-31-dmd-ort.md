A couple of weeks ago, I received [a feature request](https://gitlab.com/tanna.dev/dependency-management-data/-/issues/206) on [dependency-management-data](https://dmd.tanna.dev) to add support for [the OSS Review Toolkit (ORT)](https://oss-review-toolkit.org/ort/).

I really appreciated this, as it introduced me to an awesome project I'd not yet heard of, as well as being something that the maintainers felt that it could be a really useful integration, which is always great!

I'd recommend checking them out - there's a little overlap with some of the work that dependency-management-data does, but I'd also say that they can work really well in unison. There's a good introduction to the project and how it came to be in the first half of [Sustain OSS Podcast: Thomas Steenbergen & Josep Prat at FOSS Backstage 2023](https://podcast.sustainoss.org/166).

As of the last few releases of the `dmd` CLI, there's now support for the Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) formats that ORT produces, and as you can see in the [Getting Started with OSS Review Toolkit's data](https://dmd.tanna.dev/cookbooks/getting-started-ort/) cookbook, it's pretty straightforward to get started!

If you're using ORT and want a means to query your data in a different way, check out [dependency-management-data](https://dmd.tanna.dev).
