A week of context switching, feeling more and more run down, and generally not being the best time:

- Had to make quite a few fixes to the photo changes on my Micropub server from last week - woops!
- Finally got a new cat flap for Morph, so he's been feeling a bit safer this week
- Only did Wednesday's Ring Fit, as Monday I was still pretty exhausted from the weekend, and on Friday I'd swapped it out to make sure the house was ready for Sarah, Ross and Klara
- Had a half day on Friday to spend some time with Sarah, Ross and Klara, which was nice, and we walked over to the new house
- Had a pretty quiet Homebrew, but managed to [convert nottingham.digital to Hugo](https://github.com/nottinghamdigital/nottinghamdigital.github.io/pull/112)
- Had an interesting talk at WiT, which I need to write my notes up for, as there were some great pieces of advice in there for new managers
- Hacktoberfest started!
  - There was the start of Hacktoberfest drama with unnecessary spam across many projects, and the inevitable changes for the rules, which is making things a little bit harder for hackers, but _hopefully_ better for maintainers
  - Was on the Microsoft Cloud Skills Show talking about it - I don't feel I was very good on it, but Anna was, and I feel we got enough of the info across
  - I decided to finally get around to [fixing a bug with JobDSL that I've wanted fixed for a while](https://github.com/jenkinsci/job-dsl-plugin/pull/1232), even though it wasn't Hacktoberfest eligible, so was nice to have Hacktoberfest nudging me to do it
- House has been going on positively - now just waiting on flood survey and we're off!
- Lots of context switching at work between Asgard stories, new Asgard epics, handover, and upcoming epics
  - Fighting `PrintStream`s to securely log things has been a tough problem to solve that fortunately James solved
  - Had some fun with Gradle platforms - blog post coming soon
- Been pretty bad with looking after myself this week - more takeaways than planned, and definitely not as much sleep as I've needed
  - Rikshaw, yet again, forgot the Mango Lassi, but at least I got a second one to apologise
  - Waiting outside Rakki Rakkas in the rain because the entrance was filled with people also waiting, but not wanting to safely socially distance was pretty frustrating
- More progress with setting up the new team:
  - Definitely going to be looking at Spring Cloud Contract with the new team, and looking at whether it's something I can feed into the new work
  - Started to get a bit more depth into what we're going to be working on, and making sure that things are ready for the start of planning week this Wednesday
  - Decided on the team name, _The Purple Pandas_
  - Started - but not quite finished - getting the team to a common ways of working, but we're starting to align a lot better
  - Some ownership conversations for an existing service, and plans for the upcoming quarter
- Had a lovely Sunday evening catch up with Emma, Andrew and Carol which replaced a walk that was rained off
- A long conversation about (that person) which led to some more information which was interesting
- Headspace released some new Sleepcasts!
- Stayed up too late writing my week notes
- Had some unexpected guests
- Watched _The Gentlemen_
- Watched _The Great Hack_
- Partly watched _RBG_
