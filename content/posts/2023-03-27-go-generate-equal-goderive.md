Sometimes you need to check the equality of two `struct`s in Go, and depending on how complicated they are, you probably want to avoid hand-writing the `Equal` method if possible, and you want to avoid [`reflect.DeepEqual`](https://pkg.go.dev/reflect#DeepEqual) for performance reasons, at least in your production code.

If I were writing Java, I'd ask IntelliJ to generate an `equals` method for me, but wanted to find out if Go had a tool for this, because there usually is one. I asked around in the Go communities I'm part of, and my colleague <span class="h-card"><a class="u-url" href="https://michalbock.com/">Michal</a></span> suggested looking at [`goderive`](https://github.com/awalterschulze/goderive), which worked out very nicely for what I needed.

Although `goderive` supports many methods being generated, I only needed an `Equal` method.

Let's say that we have a slightly complex struct setup which results in this set of types:

```go
type ComplexStruct struct {
	Int      int
	MyStruct MyStruct
	Anon     Anon
}

type Anon struct {
	Nested Nested
}

type Nested struct {
	MyStruct MyStruct
}

type MyStruct struct {
	Int64     int64
	StringPtr *string
}
```

To create our own `Equal` method is OK for us to do, but we can instead use `goderive` to do the heavy lifting, by creating:

```go
func (this *ComplexStruct) Equal(that *ComplexStruct) bool {
	return deriveEqualComplexStruct(this, that)
}
```

Note that [there needs to be pointer receivers for `goderive` to generate the right equality method](https://github.com/awalterschulze/goderive/issues/81).


This will fail to compile - but that's OK, running `goderive` will then auto-generate the file `derived.gen.go` which contains the implementation we need:

```go
// deriveEqualComplexStruct returns whether this and that are equal.
func deriveEqualComplexStruct(this, that *ComplexStruct) bool {
	return (this == nil && that == nil) ||
		this != nil && that != nil &&
			this.Int == that.Int &&
			deriveEqual(&this.MyStruct, &that.MyStruct) &&
			deriveEqual_(&this.Anon, &that.Anon)
}

// deriveEqual returns whether this and that are equal.
func deriveEqual(this, that *MyStruct) bool {
	return (this == nil && that == nil) ||
		this != nil && that != nil &&
			this.Int64 == that.Int64 &&
			((this.StringPtr == nil && that.StringPtr == nil) || (this.StringPtr != nil && that.StringPtr != nil && *(this.StringPtr) == *(that.StringPtr)))
}

// deriveEqual_ returns whether this and that are equal.
func deriveEqual_(this, that *Anon) bool {
	return (this == nil && that == nil) ||
		this != nil && that != nil &&
			deriveEqual_1(&this.Nested, &that.Nested)
}

// deriveEqual_1 returns whether this and that are equal.
func deriveEqual_1(this, that *Nested) bool {
	return (this == nil && that == nil) ||
		this != nil && that != nil &&
			deriveEqual(&this.MyStruct, &that.MyStruct)
}
```

This then generates a set of methods which check the equality for all the types involved - awesome üëè
