Through a few conversations at work recently, I've found that there are a few cool things that my team - and other teams near us - are doing to write better, more maintainable, and more effective tests for API services - combining unit, unit integration, and functional acceptance testing to make a great test pyramid.

I'm going to be blogging these under a new series of posts, [writing-better-tests](/series/writing-better-tests/) - keep your eyes peeled!
