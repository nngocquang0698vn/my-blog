If you're writing command-line tools with Go, you're very likely to want to parse all of `stdin`, from the first byte, up until the End of File character (EOF).

For instance, you may be receiving input from various means:

```sh
# piping from a file
go run main.go < file.txt

# piping with a heredoc
go run main.go <<< EOF
Multi-line
heredoc
EOF

# useless use of cat, but example of piping a command
cat file.txt | go run main.go

# writing the text to stdin
go run main.go
example
text
^D
```

To read this, in its entirety, we can use `io.ReadAll` like so:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"io"
	"os"
	"strings"
)

func main() {
	// this does all the work for us!
	stdin, err := io.ReadAll(os.Stdin)

	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	str := string(stdin)

	fmt.Println(strings.TrimSuffix(str, "\n"))
}
```

As noted above, [this comment from 2018](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20895552/how-can-i-read-from-standard-input-in-the-console#comment90702537_51811249) noting that you `stdin` doesn't close no longer seems to be the case, at least in the test I performed on `go version go1.17.7 linux/amd64`.
