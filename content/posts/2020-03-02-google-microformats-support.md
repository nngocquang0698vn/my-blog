Google announced that they are [removing support for the data-vocabulary metadata](https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2020/01/data-vocabulary.html) markup that could be used to provide rich search results on its Search Engine.

In a Twitter exchange, John Mueller, a Webmaster Trends Analyst at Google, confirmed that [Microformats](https://microformats.io) are still being supported by Google at this time:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Yes, we still support them.</p>&mdash; üçå John üçå (@JohnMu) <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnMu/status/1219739919268155392?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 21, 2020</a></blockquote>

John also confirmed that he knows of no upcoming plans to deprecate Microformats:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We don&#39;t have any plans for changes to announce there at the moment. I don&#39;t know off-hand how broadly microformats are used, my guess is it&#39;s much more than data-vocabulary. That said ... <a href="https://t.co/ZCE7rTKmPa">https://t.co/ZCE7rTKmPa</a></p>&mdash; üçå John üçå (@JohnMu) <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnMu/status/1219597542318538752?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 21, 2020</a></blockquote>

This is an especially great result due to the way that Google is quite happy to abandon various metadata formats, as noted in our [7th anniversary blog post](http://microformats.org/2012/06/25/microformats-org-at-7#challenges), almost 8 years ago. With this announcement, Microformats are now the longest-supported metadata format that Google parses, [since at least 2009](http://microformats.org/wiki/google-search)!

With the continued growth of Microformats across the [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org), we expect that Google will extend its Microformats support accordingly.
