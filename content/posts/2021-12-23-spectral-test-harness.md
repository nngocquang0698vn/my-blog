Yesterday I wrote about [how to get started with TDDing Spectral API linting rules](/posts/2021/12/22/spectral-jest/).

Because I'm going to need to use it in at least one work repository, and it's likely I'll be using it in a few other places, I've decided to skip to the end and publish it as its own standalone package that can be maintained and improved centrally.

You can find this at [@jamietanna/spectral-test-harness on NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jamietanna/spectral-test-harness), and the source repo is [on GitLab at jamietanna/spectral-test-harness](https://gitlab.com/jamietanna/spectral-test-harness).

Currently it's working quite nicely for the simple use cases I've got, but I'm hoping we can improve it over time!
