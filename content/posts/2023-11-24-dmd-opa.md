A couple of months ago [I wrote about](https://www.jvt.me/posts/2023/08/29/dmd-custom-advisories/) how I find the Custom [Advisories](https://dmd.tanna.dev/concepts/advisory/) functionality in [dependency-management-data](https://dmd.tanna.dev) to be really great. It makes it possible to flag up usage of libraries that for instance are internally deprecated or not supported, and allows folks running dependency-management-data in their organisations to specify their own internal rules, as well as taking advantage of Open Source'd advisories too.

Last week I attended [OWASP Dependency Track](https://dependencytrack.org/)'s first community call, and found that their ability to manage [policy compliance](https://docs.dependencytrack.org/usage/policy-compliance/) seemed to go one step above this.

As I was considering how the custom advisories functionality worked, I considered how I would add the same functionality to dependency-management-data. Instead of introducing more logic into the database layer, I considered if there were any existing tools I could use for this, and remembered [Open Policy Agent (OPA)](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/).

In today's [v0.54.0 release of dependency-management-data](https://gitlab.com/tanna.dev/dependency-management-data/-/releases/v0.54.0), it's now possible to write OPA policies that determine whether a given package usage violates your organisation policy, and flag it in a similar way than Advisories are done, but with much more control around the dependency that's being flagged which helps reduce false positives.

The great thing about being based on OPA is that you can leverage all [the excellent support](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/policy-reference/) it has for all sorts of powerful operations. This means that if you wanted to perform a GraphQL API lookup to understand more about the project/dependency's usage in your organisation, [you can](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/policy-reference/#graphql)!

In the future, I'll be adding more information such as [licensing](https://gitlab.com/tanna.dev/dependency-management-data/-/issues/282) or [other advisory information](https://gitlab.com/tanna.dev/dependency-management-data/-/issues/285), as well as making it possible to have [other repository metadata](https://gitlab.com/tanna.dev/dependency-management-data/-/issues/271) allow you to decide whether i.e. a violation is only important when it's a public-facing repository.

This will also come with [policy linting](https://gitlab.com/tanna.dev/dependency-management-data/-/issues/278) to make it easier to write better policies, quicker.

Check out [the _Turning complex policies into custom Advisories using Open Policy Agent_ cookbook](https://dmd.tanna.dev/cookbooks/custom-advisories-opa/), and let me know if there's anything else you'd find useful to do with OPA + DMD!
