It's almost October, and you know what that means? It's almost the month-long celebration of GitHub-hosted Free and Open Source projects - [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/).

As with last year, I'm going to be running Homebrew Website Club Nottingham as a Hacktoberfest-themed event, to help give folks the time in their busy October schedules to craft some contributions for the coveted t-shirt, as well as being able to dip their toes in Free and Open Source software.

[Homebrew Website Club: Nottingham](https://events.indieweb.org/tag/hwc-nottingham)'s Hacktoberfest dates will be:

- 2020-09-30: Pre-Hacktoberfest meeting, with the chance to get a headstart for the Hacktoberfest month
- 2020-10-14: Hacktoberfest Session
- 2020-10-28: Hacktoberfest Session

# Does my Hacktoberfest have to be Homebrew Related?

No! It doesn't need to be even tangentially related to Homebrew Website Club, nor the IndieWeb. I want to use Homebrew, as an event that I organise, as a way to make a space for others to come and contribute. I realise not everyone attending will be coming with a website, or necessarily an interest in the IndieWeb - and that's completely OK! I would rather have folks coming with a space to work alongside others, and if anyone does work on these technologies, that's a bonus.

# Schedule

The format of the event will be similar to Homebrew Website Club Nottingham but will be more open for chatter and asking of questions to other attendees.

### 1730-1735: üëã Event start

A few words to say welcome, and explain the format for everyone.

### 1735-1745: Intro to Hacktoberfest and Free and Open Source Software

We'll also talk through what we're planning on doing for the session.

### 1745-1750: Project ideas

This is a chance to go around the room and see if anyone has anything they're planning on working on, or if you can get any ideas for what to work on.

### 1750-1900:üë©‚Äçüíª Social / co-working time

Time to work on the contribution you're hoping to make, with the chance to chat with other attendees as you're going.

### 1900-1905: üì∏ Photo Time!

It's nice to get a photo of the attendees (for posterity) - you'll be given a few minutes to get your video on and ready if you want to participate, or turn your camera off if not.

### 1905-1930: üì∫ Demos

If you're in a position to share what you've worked on - even if it's not fully ready - it's great to share what you've done!

### 1930: üëã Event end

A few closing remarks, and talking about when the next event will be.
