I've been doing a lot of work recently around the dependency data of various projects, which stems from a post and idea of mine from a while ago about [monetising the supply chain](https://www.jvt.me/posts/2022/06/01/idea-supply-chain-monetisation/).

Separate to that lofty goal - especially as there are some tools like [socket.dev](https://socket.dev/) and [StackAid](https://stackaid.us/) working towards this - is just being able to get some insight into the way that your organisation uses both Open Source and your own internal packages.

As mentioned on the [Dependency Management Data site](https://dmd.tanna.dev/):

> Dependency Management Data is a set of tooling to get a better understanding of the use of dependencies across your organisation.

We've been using this as a way to do work out various things like:

- what versions of AWS/Datadog/etc SDKs are we using, and are any hugely out-of-date?
- where are we using deprecated (internal) packages, that we'd ideally want to move people along from?
- where are we using versions of dependencies that have known issues (security or otherwise)?
- where are we using `golangci-lint` as a source-tracked dependency instead of as a binary download?

As part of this, I've built a couple of tools, [renovate-graph](https://gitlab.com/tanna.dev/renovate-graph) and [dependabot-graph](https://gitlab.com/tanna.dev/dependabot-graph) to make the data collection process much easier, and then there is a set of scripts that converted from the raw JSON formats to an SQLite database for easier querying.

Over the last few months of doing this a fair bit, and getting more appreciation for the data model, I've finally gotten around to writing [a tool for this](https://gitlab.com/tanna.dev/dependency-management-data/), installable as `dmd`.

Right now, this includes the ability to bootstrap the database from renovate-graph or dependabot-graph exports, but as highlighted in the [issue tracker](https://gitlab.com/tanna.dev/dependency-management-data/-/issues), there's quite a few other things I'd like to do with it, like crowdsource common queries that others may find convenient, as well as highlighting packages that are running end-of-life versions of software according to [endoflife.date](https://endoflife.date).

I'd also love to hear what other use cases y'all may have for this, or what may be interesting. I've gotten a lot out of this, as have some of my colleagues, and I'm sure others would be able to get some good usage.
