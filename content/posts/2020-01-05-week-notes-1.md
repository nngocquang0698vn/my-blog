As you will soon read in my 2019 in Review blog post, one thing I want to do this year is to write a weekly post to cover what's happened this week.

I've stolen this idea from <span class="h-card"><a class="u-url" href="https://www.zylstra.org/blog/">Ton Zijlstra</a></span>, who has been doing this for quite some time, and I really like it. It's a nice way to look back at all the things that have happened over a week/month/year, and I feel like it'll help with my [Year in Review](/series/year-in-review/) posts.

This was a short week due to New Year's Day being a Wednesday, in which I:

* Spent New Year's Eve with <span class="h-card"><a class="u-url" href="http://www.rwdrich.com/">Richard</a></span> and friends, playing board games, chatting, and having a nice time
* Saw a group of friends for a post-Xmas gathering, with the hosting pair announcing their engagement!
* Took down the Christmas decorations
* Played lots of Mario Odyssey on my Nintendo Switch
* Attended a great talk at Women in Tech Nottingham, [Sensing Change: The Rise of the Smart bins]({{< ref "2020-01-02-smart-bins" >}})
* Writing my "2018 in Review" and "2019 in Review" blog posts
* Had our first takeaway from our new nearest Thai restaurant, <span class="h-card"><a class="u-url" href="https://mrthaifood.co.uk/">Mr Thai Food</a></span>
* Finished preparations for the Release Train Planning at work, looking at the key pieces of work for the next quarter
* Fought an annoying issue at work with upgrading the version of Spring (via Spring Boot 1 to 2), where `@ConfigurationProperties` was being used, but we used properties of the form `example.tokenUrl` instead of `example.token-url` (kebab-case is recommended)
