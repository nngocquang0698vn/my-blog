Tonight I've been playing around with GitLab CI's `shell` executor, and my builds have been failing with this error:

````
Running with gitlab-runner 13.0.1 (21cb397c)
  on gitlab-runner 9vpTPhFS
Preparing the "shell" executor
00:00
Using Shell executor...

Uploading artifacts for failed job

ERROR: Job failed: exit status 1
````

After some searching online, it appeared that similar to [when receiving `No Such Directory`](/posts/2020/06/03/gitlab-ci-shell-no-such-directory/), [this comment](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/-/issues/1379#note_343017515) noted that it's an issue with SKEL - the solution was to delete `.bash_logout` from the `gitlab-runner` user's home, but I also removed `.bashrc` and `.profile`.
