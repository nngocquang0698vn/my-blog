It's National Blog Post Month! I found out about it when I saw <span class="h-card"><a class="u-url" href="https://shkspr.mobi">Terence Eden</a></span> tweeting about it this morning:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Morning nerds!<br>It&#39;s November, that means I&#39;m blogging every day for <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NaBloPoMo?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#NaBloPoMo</a>.<br>I&#39;ve got a brilliant month of new posts coming up for you.<br>But, first, here&#39;s one of my favourites from last year…<br><br>https://🅂𝖍𝐤ₛᵖ𝒓.ⓜ𝕠𝒃𝓲/🆆🆃🅵/<br><br>Copy &amp; paste that URl - it&#39;s magic!</p>&mdash; Terence Eden (@edent) <a href="https://twitter.com/edent/status/1190168095459033088?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 1, 2019</a></blockquote>

This is a pretty cool thing, and it turns out my friends in the IndieWeb community may know about it as [there is a wiki page for _National Blog Posting Month_](https://indieweb.org/National_Blog_Posting_Month).

I've decided that I too will be celebrating it, and will be doing it as a way to help me push out posts that are smaller, and have a bit less time invested in them, because some of my posts are incredibly long and require a lot of time to get them written. But I want to improve my ability to write something quickly, so that's what's happening.

When saying I was going to participate, my friend <span class="h-card"><a class="u-url" href="https://twitter.com/MrAndrew/">Andrew Seward</a></span> jokes:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">And this will be different?</p>&mdash; Andrew Seward (@MrAndrew) <a href="https://twitter.com/MrAndrew/status/1190193720026652672?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 1, 2019</a></blockquote>

I get it, I blog a lot 😅 Expect to see lots of smaller chunks of content over the month (tagged under [nablopomo](/tags/nablopomo)), and I hope I'll be able to keep up with it.
