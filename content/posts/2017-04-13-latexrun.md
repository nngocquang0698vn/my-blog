# Where We Are Now

I recently [stumbled across][latex-tooling] a tool called [`latexrun`][latexrun], which aims to build your LaTeX files in a much more clean, and user-friendly way.

For those of you that haven't used LaTeX before, when building a LaTeX project, you need to compile the `.tex` files into (among other formats) a final `.pdf`, which is usually done by invoking `pdflatex file.tex` or `xelatex file.tex`. However, in order to update references, diagrams, and other metadata within the document, you will need to perform (up to) three passes of `pdflatex`. This can be either performed manually, or by using the [`latexmk`][latexmk] tool, which orchestrates this for you, including determining whether it actually _does_ need to keep going, or if it's updated all the resources.

However, the output of these multiple runs can get fairly unwieldy. For example, when building [my Git workshop slides][gitworkshop], the output of `make` was a total of 1643 lines. That is a huge amount of output - almost _three times as many as the actual file I was compiling_! This process is one that I'll be running either on every save, or at periodic intervals while working on LaTeX documents, and I'll be potentially reading through fairly regularly. A sample of the output itself looks like this:

```

ick labels; missing features). Consider writing \pgfplotsset{compat=1.14} into
your preamble.
 on input line 57.

```

All the extra output obscures errors and makes it very difficult to understand what's going on or going wrong. My debugging is often _"going up the logs until I can find something that from experience looks like it could be an issue"_. It's even less scientific than it sounds because I actually just look at the structure of the output - sometimes errors are output in a specific way alongside the rest of the log, so I look for that. If there was much less output to hide the real issues, it wouldn't be quite so difficult, even with [a page on the LaTeX wiki about errors and warnings][latex-errors-warnings]. I even found that while working on my dissertation (written in LaTeX), I would actually just leave the files with broken compilations, as it was easier not to worry about it until a later point.

# `latexrun` to the Rescue

However, when the above error, `latexrun` provides the following, more friendly, output:

```
(...)
intro-to-git-workshop.tex:211: warning: Overfull \vbox (8.83098pt too high) (page 13)
intro-to-git-workshop.tex:222: warning: Reference `sub:good_commit_messages' on page 14 undefined
intro-to-git-workshop.tex: error: File ended while scanning use of \beamer@collect@@body
      at <inserted text> \par
                         ^
    from <*> intro-to-git-workshop.tex
intro-to-git-workshop.tex: error: Emergency stop: job aborted, no legal \end found
      at <*> intro-to-git-workshop.tex
```

With the much more bite-sized and obvious errors and warnings that `latexrun` outputs, it's not hard to see why I'm looking to [update my starter kit for LaTeX documents][latex-starter-7] to integrate with `latexrun` as it makes debugging even just simply compiling the files so much easier.
