It's possible that you're using OpenAPI specifications to describe the format of your API.

If you're on a Java project, it may be that you're currently manually translating from OpenAPI data types to Plain Old Java Objects (POJOs), which is time consuming and has the risk of drifting between your definitions and implementations.

One of the benefits of using a very structured format like the format in OpenAPI specifications is that you can programmatically generate the contents of your Java models, or any other languages you may be using, for that matter.

# Example OpenAPI specification

We'll base this on the OpenAPI specification demo from the [Petstore](https://petstore3.swagger.io/api/v3/openapi.json), but this also works with OpenAPI specs that have `$ref`s out to JSON schema documents, too!

# Generating the POJOs

We can utilise the [openapi-generator Gradle plugin](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/tree/master/modules/openapi-generator-gradle-plugin) to generate this for us, using the following Gradle configuration:

```groovy
plugins {
  id 'java'
  id 'org.openapi.generator' version '5.4.0'
}

openApiGenerate {
  generatorName = "java"
  inputSpec = "$rootDir/specs/petstore.yaml".toString()
  outputDir = "$buildDir/generated/sources/openapi".toString()
  modelPackage = "io.swagger.petstore3.api.models"
  generateModelTests = false // personal preference, as it's JUnit 4
  globalProperties = [
    // force only the models
    apis: "false",
    invokers: "false",
    models: "",
  ]
  configOptions = [
    dateLibrary: "java8",
  ]
}

compileJava.dependsOn tasks.openApiGenerate

sourceSets.main.java.srcDirs += "$buildDir/generated/sources/openapi/src/main/java"
```

This is a bit stricter to only generate the classes for models, but we can also generate other API metadata such as an autogenerated client for interacting with the API!
