Let's say that we've got a buffer in Vim, and we want to replace some of the text with the output of a command.

For instance, we may have found a JSON Web Token (JWT), like the below:

```
eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiaWF0IjoxNTE2MjM5MDIyfQ.SflKxwRJSMeKKF2QT4fwpMeJf36POk6yJV_adQssw5c
```

If we have a handy executable called `jwt`, we'd be able to select the text, then execute the following command:

```
'<,'>!jwt
```

Which can also be seen in the following Asciicast:

<asciinema-player src="/casts/vim-replace-with-command-execution.json"></asciinema-player>

This does not work, however, if you've got the following, where we want to unpack the internal JWT in this JSON object:

```json
{
  "client_assertion": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiaWF0IjoxNTE2MjM5MDIyfQ.SflKxwRJSMeKKF2QT4fwpMeJf36POk6yJV_adQssw5c"
}
```

For how to do that, check out my article [running a command on a visual selection in Vim](/posts/2022/03/03/vim-command-visual-selection/).
