There are some posts in the past that I've written that have been in a similar vein, or part of a larger set of posts.

To make them discoverable, I've used tags i.e. [pretty-print](/tags/pretty-print/). But today, I've made it possible to discover these via the [series](/series/) metadata.

As part of adding this, I've marked up a number of old posts which fit under this categorisation, as well as everything in [2019's NaBloPoMo](/series/nablopomo-2019/) accordingly.

I've also added a question to my [Merge Request Template for articles](/posts/2019/11/17/article-checklist/) to ensure that I remember to tag new articles correctly.
