# Why?

I work with a number of certificates, and probably the thing I like about them most (but also least!) is how they have a built-in requirement for regular rotation.

Because I work with a number of certificates, I want to make sure that I know ahead of time when I need to plan to rotate them, instead of leaving it until it's last minute (at least for cases where I'm not using Let's Encrypt).

The best way I've found this works is by tracking their expiries in my calendar, so as I'm looking week(s) into the future, I can see what needs to be rotated soon.

I've looked at writing one-off scripts to set these alerts up, but wasn't as much of a fan, as I'd need to keep re-running the scripts.

Because the certs I'm using are generally exposed on a JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) endpoint, I decided to build on the idea of these scripts to generate calendar entries, and have created a lightweight API that can take a given JWKS, parse the X509 certificate from the `x5c` field, and return an iCalendar feed.

# Demo

You can interact with the API by performing a GET request on the below URL:

```sh
https://europe-west1-jwksical-jvt-me.cloudfunctions.net/jwks-ical
  ?jwks_uri=$jwks_uri
```

Where `jwks_uri` is a URI for a given JWKS endpoint, such as `https://jamietanna.eu.auth0.com/.well-known/jwks.json`:

```json

(Aside: if you're interested in what the certs look like, check out [_Extracting `x5c`s from a JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) to PEM files with Ruby_]({{< ref 2020-04-30-jwks-to-pem >}})).

By running this JWKS URI through the jwks-ical API, you will be returned with the following iCalendar representation:

```

Which you can feed into your calendar reader of choice, and keep an eye on when your certificates are expiring.

## Providing more event context

If you've got lots of certs you're keeping an eye of, or if you want to make it more obvious when you've got a production certificate expiring, you can provide a value for the querystring parameter `prefix`:

```
https://europe-west1-jwksical-jvt-me.cloudfunctions.net/jwks-ical
  ?jwks_uri=$jwks_uri
  &prefix=Auth0+Production
```

Which generates a slightly different event description, to make it a little more obvious:

```diff

  xQzc5MUY0MjI2Nw (with use: `sig` and subject: `CN=jamietanna.eu.auth0.com`
  ) is expiring on Mon Jun 21 12:01:32 UTC 2032

 END:VEVENT
```

## Insecure SSL/TLS configuration

Because I want to use this with Open Banking's certificates, I needed to disable the SSL/TLS validation, as `https://keystore.openbanking.org.uk/` uses a self-signed certificate.

Is this a dealbreaker for your own use cases? Let me know, and I can move to a per-JWKS configuration for insecure connections.

## Performance

This is a Java function, so note that performance isn't exactly going to be perfect. But a) I wanted to write it in Java and b) the performance doesn't need to be perfect, as it doesn't need to be realtime.

# Vanity URL

This is my first experience with [Google Cloud Functions](https://cloud.google.com/functions), and I've found it pretty fun to work with. Unfortunately I couldn't get a custom domain working properly with Google Cloud Functions, even using Firebase, so for now you can use `https://europe-west1-jwksical-jvt-me.cloudfunctions.net/jwks-ical`.

If that's a bit of a mouthful, you can use `https://u.jvt.me/jwks-ical` to remember it.
