In August I [announced a Microformats API for Meetup.com: `meetup-mf2.herokuapp.com`]({{< ref "2019-08-31-microformats-meetup" >}}) to act as a translation layer between the silo and the IndieWeb.

I've been using this as a core part of my own workflow for RSVPing to events, but that's usually when I see the event actually on Meetup.com and then manually RSVP from my website.

To make it so I could discover new events from my [Indie reader](https://indieweb.org/reader), it would be really nice to have an [`h-feed`](https://indieweb.org/h-feed).

With the [v0.2.0 release](https://gitlab.com/jamietanna/meetup-mf2/-/tags/0.2.0) (now in production!) this is now available for usage, which you can do with the following request to get the upcoming events for a given Meetup.com group:

```json

        {

                    }

            ],
            "type": [

                "url": [
                    "https://www.meetup.com/Tech-Nottingham/events"
                ]
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

Because this exposes an Microformats2 JSON feed, it should be possible to subscribe to a given Meetup.com group.

~~Note: If you're trying to use it with [Aperture](https://aperture.p3k.io), [there's a PR that needs to be merged](https://github.com/aaronpk/XRay/pull/94) before it'll work.~~ This is now works with [Aperture](https://aperture.p3k.io)!

Another thing to note is that this will only show upcoming events for a given group - hopefully that's all you need, but feel free to [use the issue tracker if you want the option](https://gitlab.com/jamietanna/meetup-mf2/issues).
