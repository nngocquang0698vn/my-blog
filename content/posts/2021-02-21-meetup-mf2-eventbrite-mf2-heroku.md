After many months of running Microformats API for Meetup.com and Eventbrite.com from my own infrastructure, I'm moving it over to Heroku.

This is more to simplify my hosting setup, and because Heroku is a nice platform to use.

As a consumer, please note that you'll need to move to the new URLs, `meetup-mf2.herokuapp.com` and `eventbrite-mf2.herokuapp.com`. I think redirects may be working for now, but it won't be there forever.

I've updated my previous articles to reference this, but if you're using it, please update your references too!
