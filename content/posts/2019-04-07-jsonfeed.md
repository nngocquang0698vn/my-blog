I've noticed that within the IndieWeb community, there are [several options](https://indieweb.org/feed_file) for marking up your list of content.

I've had [an RSS feed](/feed.xml) for some time, both through my Jekyll and Hugo sites, but now I'm looking to extend my site with other formats.

And with this post, I'm announcing that I'm exposing a [JSON feed](https://jsonfeed.org/version/1) [for my site](/feed.json).

This was with some help from <span class="h-card"><a href="https://ig.nore.me" class="p-name u-url">Arjen Schwarz</a></span>'s post [JSON Feed and Hugo Output Formats](https://ig.nore.me/2017/05/json-feed-and-hugo-output-formats/) to actually get Hugo generating it in the right place.

With a JSON feed, it allows for further interoperability with IndieWeb clients who prefer the format over RSS!

And I'm [soon going to add h-feed support](https://gitlab.com/jamietanna/jvt.me/issues/393) for Microformats goodness.
