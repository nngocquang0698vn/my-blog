As mentioned in [_Using Renovate to manage updates to `golangci-lint` versions_](https://www.jvt.me/posts/2022/12/15/renovate-golangci-lint/), Renovate is great for managing your dependency updates.

By using [the custom regex manager](https://docs.renovatebot.com/modules/manager/regex/), we can craft the following Renovate configuration:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://docs.renovatebot.com/renovate-schema.json",
  "regexManagers": [
    {
      "fileMatch": [
        ".sh$"
      ],
      "matchStrings": [
        "go install (?<depName>[^@]+?)@(?<currentValue>[0-9.-a-zA-Z]+)"
      ],
      "datasourceTemplate": "go"
    }
  ]
}
```

This then allows us to take commands such as:

```sh
go install github.com/deepmap/oapi-codegen@v1.11.0
```

Note that this will not try and update dependencies that aren't pointing to tags, such as `@latest`, `@HEAD` or pointing to a Git SHA.

**Note** This doesn't currently work for [anything `go install`ing a non-module import](https://gitlab.com/tanna.dev/jvt.me/-/issues/1310)
