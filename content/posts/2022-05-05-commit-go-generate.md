I've recently had the conversation about whether [`go:generate`'d](https://go.dev/blog/generate) code should be committed, to which I steered towards "no".

Coming from a Java background, I wouldn't commit generated files, instead let the build tool generate + package up the code into the built artefact.

This makes it easier as we get a freshly generated version each time, as well as needing to ignore code reviewing files generated by the tooling.

As I'm still new to the Go world, I forgot that Go doesn't distribute a built package, only source packages, which [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/56417892) helped reinforce.

Therefore the answer is **yes** we do want to commit the code, so folks using the package can still interact with it, instead of needing to run the generation on their side, too.
