At [DevOpsDays London 2023](https://devopsdays.org/events/2023-london/welcome/) there was a great session called "Let's talk compensation", off the back of a very successful session that was run at DevOpsDays Chicago.

(Aside: I'm hoping to finish up my writeup of DevOpsDays London soon, so I won't spoil too much of the session)

Aside from talking about salary, we also spoke a little bit about on-call payments, and whether folks were paid extra, it was part of the salary, or they would i.e. get time off in lieu.

Following the great success of [publishing my salary publicly](/salary/), I thought it'd be good to do my on-call pay too, in [my on-call compensation history](/on-call-compensation/) page.

It's unfortunately not as detailed as it probably could be, but hopefully is a good start and point of interest.

Before I'd left Deliveroo I was writing a blog post about what it's like to be on-call as an engineer (in my team), but it's not yet gone live on the Deliveroo Engineering site. Hopefully it will be live soon, as it was part of a series around various angles of what it's like to be on-call, and I was really looking forward to sharing it, as we did some good stuff.

Hope the data helps!
