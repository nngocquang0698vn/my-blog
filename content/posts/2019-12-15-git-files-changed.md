I've found in the past that it can be useful to know what files have changed in a given commit, i.e. to re-edit them, or to [add whitespace to the end of file](/posts/2019/09/02/newlines-all-git-files/).

We can do this with the `diff-tree` subcommand, giving it a commit to look at, and it'll return a list of all files changed:

```sh
$ git diff-tree --no-commit-id --name-only -r HEAD
$ git diff-tree --no-commit-id --name-only -r e08f540464a6adbddda7de71b85fc793ddfac2a8

```
