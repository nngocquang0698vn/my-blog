This last week I've been setting up my own [IndieAuth server](https://indieauth.spec.indieweb.org/), which I've been thinking about doing for some time.

The key thing I wanted to do was streamline my authentication flow, as if I build a server just for me, I can make it work with my own constraints. On my [staging site]({{< ref 2019-12-26-micropub-staging-server >}}), which I use a lot for testing, I only have email one time passcodes set up, which slows me down more than a regular OAuth2 login.

<span class="h-card"><a class="u-url p-name" href="https://aaronparecki.com">Aaron Parecki</a></span> [wrote about setting up Passwordless authentication on his website](https://aaronparecki.com/2017/10/04/23/passwordless-logins) and since reading it, I was like, yep, I need to implement it.

I know Aaron hasn't yet had a chance to write this up, but as I've worked on it for my own site this last week, I thought I'd explain how I did it!

# Prerequisites

Firstly, I set up a new Okta developer account, which gave me a new Okta domain.

Next, I needed to activate the Okta Verify functionality, and enable the Push notifications functionality:

![A screenshot of the Okta Multifactor settings page, with the Okta Verify page showing that it is `Active` and `Enable Push Notifications` ticked](https://media.jvt.me/168023441c.png)

(Aside: I was pretty confused when first setting this up, but with the help of Okta's support team, I found that the Factors API is only available in the non-developer UI, on the path `${oktaDomain}/admin/access/multifactor`.)

Once Okta Verify is enabled and we've set up Push notifications, we're able to enroll our device.

# Authenticating to Okta's API

Before we can go any further, we need to be able to authenticate to the Okta API to onboard / verify our device.

We have two choices - we can either register an OAuth2 app, or we can use a plain API token - I've opted for the API token for ease of use, but it's up to you.

# Enrolling the device

Next, we need to onboard our device. I made use of the [Postman collections](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/postman-collections/) as it does a little bit extra for you, but the pure [Factors API documentation](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/factors/) also works great.

I followed the steps to send the request to [enroll a push factor](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/factors/#enroll-okta-verify-push-factor), and then took the link from the response that contained the QR Code (in JSON path `$._embedded.activation.qrcode.href`), loaded it in a browser and scanned it with my phone.

Then, I polled the response from the activation (in JSON path `$._links.poll.href`) to get the `factorId` and recorded that and my `userId`.

# Verifying the device

Now I had the two of these, and a means to authenticate to the API, the fun part started - I had to be able to issue a challenge as part of my authentication flow.

We can follow Okta's documentation and [issue the challenge](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/factors/#enroll-okta-verify-push-factor), at which point my phone pops up with a notification, and accepting it means I have authenticated. Polling [the verification endpoint](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/factors/#enroll-okta-verify-push-factor) allows the API to confirm whether the request is accepted / denied or fails for other reasons.

This was relatively straightforward to get set up and works really nicely for a way to easily authenticate myself in applications.
