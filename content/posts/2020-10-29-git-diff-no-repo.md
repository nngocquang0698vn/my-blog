I really like using `git diff`, as it's got some good defaults, and has some good options on top of it.

But when you're not in a Git repo, you can't use it, right? Not quite.

Fortunately, there's the `--no-index` flag which allows you to diff between files that aren't related to a Git repo:

```sh
# does not work, returns status code 0
git diff README.md ../other-repo/README.md
# works, returns status code 1 and the diff
git diff --no-index README.md ../other-repo/README.md
```
