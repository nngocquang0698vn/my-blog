This is a companion post to go alongside [my talk writeup](https://www.jvt.me/posts/2023/07/25/dmd-getting-started/) of [my talk at DevOpsNotts July 2023](https://www.meetup.com/devops-notts/events/293929326/) about [the dependency-management-data (DMD) project](https://dmd.tanna.dev)

This is intended as a quick setup guide, rather than an exhaustive jump into what it is and how it works - if you'd like that, check out the talk writeup üëÜ

Want to know a bit more in-depth what it is and how it works? I've recently [spoken at DevOpsNotts](https://www.meetup.com/devops-notts/events/293929326/) about it and I [have done a talk writeup] which digs into it a little further.

## TL;DR extraordinaire

At a minimum, you need to:

- retrieve some data, for instance via [renovate-graph](https://gitlab.com/tanna.dev/renovate-graph)
- create the SQLite database for dependency-management-data
- import the data

We can do this by running:

```sh
go install dmd.tanna.dev/cmd/dmd@latest

# produce some data that DMD can import, for instance via renovate-graph
npx @jamietanna/renovate-graph@latest --token $GITHUB_TOKEN your-org/repo another-org/repo
# or for GitLab
env RENOVATE_PLATFORM=gitlab npx @jamietanna/renovate-graph@latest --token $GITLAB_TOKEN your-org/repo another-org/nested/repo

# set up the database
dmd db init --db dmd.db
# import renovate-graph data
dmd import renovate --db dmd.db 'out/*.json'
# then you can start querying it
sqlite3 dmd.db 'select count(*) from renovate'
```

## Retrieving the data

As noted above, we need to retrieve data to be imported into DMD. For dependencies, I'd recommend using [renovate-graph](https://gitlab.com/tanna.dev/renovate-graph), which uses [Renovate](https://docs.renovatebot.com) as the engine for retrieving package data.

We can run the following:

```sh
# optional, allows renovate-graph to retrieve the `current_version` column, as well as populate the `renovate_updates` table
export RG_INCLUDE_UPDATES='true'

# produce some data that DMD can import, for instance via renovate-graph
npx @jamietanna/renovate-graph@latest --token $GITHUB_TOKEN jamietanna/jamietanna deepmap/oapi-codegen
# or for GitLab
env RENOVATE_PLATFORM=gitlab npx @jamietanna/renovate-graph@latest --token $GITLAB_TOKEN tanna.dev/serve jamietanna/tidied
```

If you are looking at AWS infrastructure, check out the [README for endoflife-checker](https://gitlab.com/tanna.dev/endoflife-checker) which explains in more details how to pull AWS data.

## Creating the database and importing the data

Once `renovate-graph` has executed, you'll see an `out` directory with one file per repo.

First, we'll create the database:

```sh
# or any name, really
dmd db init --db dmd.db
```

Then, we need to import the data. Notice the quotes around the argument to avoid shell globbing

```sh
dmd import renovate --db dmd.db 'out/*.json'
```

Now our database is ready to go üëè

## Generating advisories (optional)

This is an optional step, but allows us to get some more meaningful information about our dependencies.

We can run the following to set up our advisories:

```sh
# optionally fetch community-sourced custom advisories
dmd contrib download

# then generate advisories for all our packages
# note that this can take several minutes depending on how many dependencies you have!
dmd db generate advisories --db dmd.db
```

## Running some queries

Now we've got the data available, we can **??**.

It's recommended you find your SQLite browser of choice and try the following queries:

```sql
-- how many packages have been ingested via renovate-graph
select count(*) from renovate

-- how many pending package updates have been ingested via renovate-graph
select count(*) from renovate_updates

-- how many packages have been ingested via dependabot-graph
select count(*) from dependabot

-- what are your most popular 10 transitive Go dependencies?
select
  distinct package_name,
  count(*)
from
  renovate,
  json_each(dep_types) as dep_type
where
  package_manager = 'gomod'
  and dep_type.value = 'indirect'
group by
  package_name
order by
  count(*) DESC
limit 10;

```

And from the `dmd` CLI, we can also run the following:

```sh
# if you've generated the advisories data
dmd report advisories --db dmd.db

dmd report mostPopularDockerImages --db dmd.db
dmd report mostPopularPackageManagers --db dmd.db
```

## Example

Interested in seeing what it's like with some pre-baked data? The [example project](https://gitlab.com/tanna.dev/dependency-management-data-example) has a web app [hosted on Fly.io](https://dependency-management-data-example.fly.dev/) that contains a lot of public repositories from GitHub and GitLab which can give you an idea based on some pre-seeded data.
