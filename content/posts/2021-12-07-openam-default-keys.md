[OpenAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAM) is a very widely deployed Identity and Access Management solution.

Whether it's using a no-longer-maintained version from [the original Forgerock supported Open Source codebase](https://github.com/OpenRock/OpenAM) or the [OpenIdentityPlatform fork](https://github.com/OpenIdentityPlatform/OpenAM), or you're using the [Forgerock Access Management platform](https://www.forgerock.com/platform/access-management), you may be needing to get access to the default private keys that are baked into the product.

This hopefully isn't going to be required for your primary usage (i.e. in production) because you'll be following best practices and not using a private key that's effectively world-readable ðŸ˜³ But you may, as a member of the [red team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_team), have found a case where a server is still using these keys, and therefore can launch an attack using these keys, or you may want to create a Proof of Concept and want to utilise the default keys as they're already handily available.

As well as being provisioned onto the server when installing (Open)AM, they're actually baked into the WAR file that's used.

For example we'll look at `OpenAM-ServerOnly-14.6.4.war`, but they should be available in similar places in the commercial version:

```sh
# via https://www.jvt.me/posts/2020/02/25/unzip-jar/
unzip -l OpenAM-ServerOnly-14.6.4.war | grep keystore

You'll notice that we've got a mix of key types - we've got `PrivateKeyEntry` and `SecretKeyEntry` that we need to expose.

Fortunately, it's straightforward to extract these, so we can follow [_Extract a Private Key from a Java Keystore_](https://www.jvt.me/posts/2020/03/20/extract-private-key-java-keystore/) and [_Extract a Secret Key from a Java Keystore_](https://www.jvt.me/posts/2019/08/02/extract-secret-key-java-keystore/) to grab the keys and use them for whatever benign or nefarious reasons we want!
