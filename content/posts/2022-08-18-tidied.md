If you're working with Go projects that use Go modules, you may be aware of the format of the `go.mod` and `go.sum`, which are used to track dependencies and their checksums respectfully.

For instance, if we take the following `go.mod`, you'll notice there are two sections for dependencies:

```go.mod
module jvt.me/dotfiles/shorten

go 1.18

require (
	github.com/deepmap/oapi-codegen v1.11.1-0.20220629212257-2cf7fcf5b26d
	github.com/spf13/viper v1.10.1
)

require (
	github.com/fsnotify/fsnotify v1.5.1 // indirect
	github.com/google/uuid v1.3.0 // indirect
  // ...
)
```

The split here is directly used dependencies, and indirectly used dependencies which are also known as transitive dependencies. To avoid developers hand-writing this file and moving things about, we can rely on the `go mod tidy` command to automate reformatting and management of the `go.mod`, as well as updating the `go.sum` if checksums are outdated.

One of the problems of _not_ running it regularly is that it can bloat your exposed list of dependencies, making it a requirement that consumers pull all of the dependencies every time they pull your project.

For instance, if we `go get` a new dependency, but don't run `go mod tidy`, we'll end up leaving that as a direct dependency, so all consumers will be expected to depend on that, too.

This is the case [even though newer versions trim the downloaded list of dependencies](https://stackoverflow.com/a/66178556).

The bloating of dependencies may not be as noticeable in your project, but if you're using `go mod vendor`, it can be very noticeable.

So how can we get around it? My initial solution has been running:

```sh
# via https://www.jvt.me/posts/2022/04/29/git-uncommitted-changes/ and https://www.jvt.me/posts/2022/05/23/git-diff-index-0-changed/
go mod tidy && git status; git diff-index --quiet HEAD --
```

However, this little incantation everywhere is a little awkward to copy-paste and explain to folks, and I feel it's common enough to need something easier.

Until [support is native in the Go toolchain](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/27005), I've created a new tool `tidied`, which can be found [on GitLab](https://gitlab.com/jamietanna/tidied), and can be run like so:

```sh
$ go install gitlab.com/jamietanna/tidied@latest
$ tidied && echo $?
1
# alternatively, make it verbose
$ tidied -verbose && echo $?
Detected untracked changes after running `go mod tidy`:
...
1
```

This should make it a slightly easier way to test everything is aligned, and I'm looking forward to use it across all my projects.
