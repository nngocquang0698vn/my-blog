title: RSVPs
---
I attend a lot of events, and as such I've started to own my RSVPs on this website.

If you would like to see the RSVPs as I add them, please check out [/kind/rsvps/](/kind/rsvps/).

It may be more helpful to see the events in a calendar view, which I've set up below with a Google Calendar embed:

<p>

</p>

If you're interested in keeping up to date on what events I'm attending, you add the calendar itself to your own calendar with the URL [`https://rsvp-calendar.tanna.dev/feed?url=https://www.jvt.me/kind/rsvps/`](https://rsvp-calendar.tanna.dev/feed?url=https://www.jvt.me/kind/rsvps/).
