    - I'm now in my third and final year of Computer Science at the University of Nottingham. I spent a year placement at Intel between my second and third year, where I worked in the Developer Relation Division, working on a large UK Android tablet deal, and playing with <a href="http://software.intel.com/realsense">Intel Realsense</a>.
    - For my final year dissertation, I am working on <em>'Mobile Style Applications for Linux'</em>, which aims to provide permissions for Linux packages, focussing on protection of privacy. For more details, please check out <a href="/projects/linux_access_permissions">the project page</a>.
    - This year I'm most looking forward to the <em>Compilers</em>, <em>Software Quality Management</em>, <em>Machine Learning</em> and <em>Mobile Device Programming</em>.
 - title: Arch Linux User

   description:
    - I run <a href="https://archlinux.org">Arch Linux</a> installations on my <a href="/devices/desktop">desktop</a> and <a href="/devices/laptop">laptop</a>. They run a minimal system, preferring a Tiling WM called <a href="https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm">BSPWM</a> over a fully blown environment such as Gnome, as it allows me to maintain a keyboard-driven setup which greatly increases my productivity.
    - I choose to use Arch Linux over other distributions because Arch gives me the choice with how I want to run my machine; by default Arch has no installer, meaning you have to install your Operating System from scratch. Although this sounds complicated, the <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Beginners%27_guide">Beginner's Guide</a> is incredibly well documented, and provides a really easy way to get set up the way you want to. This level of control is not really found in other major distributions, aside from maybe Gentoo, and definitely not found in that of Windows or Mac OSX; as I am a believer of developing and optimising workflow, I like having a system in which I don't have more moving parts than is needed, or that feels bloated by different software I don't need.
    - I also love <a href="https://wiki.installgentoo.com/index.php/GNU/Linux_ricing">ricing</a> <a href="//blog.jamietanna.co.uk/devices">my Arch Linux installs</a>. I never feel quite happy with my setup, so will constantly try to improve it; my installs are evolutionary, not static.

   description:
    - I hold the philosophy of "if you have to repeat a task more than twice, you need to automate it". One of the best things about being a programmer is that I have the ability to do this - to automate the repetitive tasks that I'd rather not continually do. Whether this is rerunning my tests as soon as a source file has changed, or filling out a form that little bit quicker, I'll automate it.
    - By automating these small tasks, it means I get to spend more time on the important things, like <a href="#projects" style="color:red">actually building cool things</a>.
    - I primarily use one-liners in Bash, but if it gets to be more complicated I will most probably write a Bash script, or for more robust scripts, and ease of readability and maintenance, write it in Python.
    - Unfortunately, I seem to fall prey to the ever relevant XKCDs; <a href="https://xkcd.com/1319">Automation</a>, <a href="https://xkcd.com/1205/">Is It Worth the Time?</a> and <a href="https://xkcd.com/974/">The General Problem</a>.
 - title: Competitive Programmer

   description:
   - Since my second year of university, I have enjoyed participating in ACM-style programming competitions. These have been useful not just for the ability to expand my problem solving skills, but also for the chance to learn C++ in much more depth, exposing me to the ins and outs of the C++ Standard Library.
   - I primarily work as the programmer, as between my team I am most competent at the programming side given my experience in the past with competitive programming.
   - I've recently started using a TDD approach to automate testing of problems, which allows me to run my tests on each file save.<span style="color:red">This process allows me to very quickly determine whether my code passes ___</span>. This allows me to focus on implementing solutions instead of being <span style="color:red">bogged down</span> by working out the best method of testing.

   description:
   - I regularly participate in hackathons, where I love spending the weekend learning something new and building something awesome. I don't always have a finished project to show for it, but I really enjoy the learning process itself.
   - I have found recently that I have been taking more of a teaching role, teaming up with less experienced hackers, and helping them with learning something new, than building something myself. On the whole, this provides me with a way to test my own knowledge, and to also give back to the community.

I can be found playing a variety of games on <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/professorgumby/">Steam</a>, leading my squad on <a href="http://battlelog.battlefield.com/bf4/user/gumbyesq/">Battlefield 4</a>, and until recently, running heists on <a href="https://pd2stats.com/profiles/76561197994125679">Payday 2</a>.

   description:
   - For the past few years, I have been developing my skills as a sysadmin, by hosting a web server that provides websites for a few clients that I developed websites for.
   - My server skills were built upon further when I was working at Intel <span style="color:red">LINK</span>, and was tasked with setting up an internal server in which to host files, and run Android builds on.
   - As part of my work, I have also been working with Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment tools, such as setting up the <a href="http://hacknotts.com">HackNotts</a> site with <a href="http://travis-ci.com">Travis-CI</a> which deployed to Amazon S3, or <a href="http://capistranorb.com">Capistrano</a> as a deploy tool for <a href="http://inspirewit.com">the Nottingham Women in Tech conference site</a>.

   description:
   - I have always enjoyed teaching people; from GCSE my Computing teachers often told me that I should pursue a career in teaching, as I have always found <span style="color:red">solice</span> in the ability to help others. This has continued into my second year at University, where I applied to the Guru scheme, which was a team of hand-selected students to provide a _mentor_ capacity for first-year students, and aiding them with work where required. In addition, I co-organised the first Hacksoc <em>Introduction to Programming sessions</em>, which took students with no prior programming knowledge and brought them to the level of learning how to develop Android apps.
   - After returning from my year at Intel, I decided that this was not the best course of action; the knowledge needed was vast, and required too much work to teach the fundamentals of programming through Java, and then leading into Android programming, all within one term. Instead, I decided that we would teach programming through Python, as a beginner-friendly language, with the final goal of leaning Flask, the microwebframework. Over the autumn term in 2015, I've found this to be an extremely effective course of action, and have had great feedback on the sessions.
