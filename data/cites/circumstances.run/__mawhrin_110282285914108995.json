    "summary" : [ "so if you're wondering why black twitter found bluesky more accommodating, the bluesky reps are (at least making an appearance of) actively listening to their concerns, while providing some of the tools they need (e.g. quote posts) from the very outset.\n\nat the same time, mainstream mastodon:\n\n* has no quote toots and not even a timeline to implement, despite existing implementations of the functionality being deployed elsewhere,\n* has abysmal search functionality and nixed complete improved search implementation out of pure spite, because gargron is a spoiled manchild,\n* has no way to share moderation burden across the instances,\n* has no ability to set up an instance with blocklist/allowlists by default,\n* the moderation interface is terrible, the tools are of abysmal quality, giving no way to communicate back to the original reporter using the very same interface,\n* onboarding is a russian roulette,\n* and to make it even worse, there's no way to move your content betwen servers, so every single time you choose your server wrongly, you lose all the work you put into it\n\nâ€¦and in the general case mastodon admin and/or moderator is very, very white and very entitled.\n\n(and every single time you say any of this, your voice is being drowned by the hooting of the fucking sea lions.)\n\nwhile gargron's current priority is to provide dedicated mastodon ios apps. which should be, frankly, the least of his priorities." ],
