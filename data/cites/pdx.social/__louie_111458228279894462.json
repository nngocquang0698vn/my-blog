    "summary" : [ "For modern \"subscriptions,\" all the money you spent provides no value after you end the subscription.\n\nThat's not a subscription, that's club membership. You're only paying for access.\n\nThat means they can and will change what access means. They'll add or remove things. They'll change the price. But in the end, when you stop paying, all the access is revoked.\n\nI really hate how that feels, and would like to move away from that in any place I can, to be honest." ],
