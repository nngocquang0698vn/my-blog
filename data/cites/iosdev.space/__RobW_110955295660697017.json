But for a white person I have very dark skin.\nRecently we were having a family conversation about how I *always* get stopped at airport security. My mum said ‘it’s because of the colour of your skin’.\nThe thought had never crossed my mind before, and I honestly don’t think my skin is that dark, I’m firmly on the border between ‘okay’ and ‘not okay’ on the family guy meme.\nMaybe I’m giving airport security too much credit." ],
