    "summary" : [ "I've not been around much because ✨Life Chaos™️✨, but yesterday the publication of an article and documentary by the BBC about a \"journalist\" faking ADHD to get a diagnosis has enraged me.\n\nI paid to go through a private diagnosis because my undiagnosed and untreated ADHD was destroying my life. The NHS kept rebuffing me and even if I did get referred, it would have taken years because of the chronic underfunding the NHS has received since 2010.\n\n#ADHD #BBC #Panorama" ],
