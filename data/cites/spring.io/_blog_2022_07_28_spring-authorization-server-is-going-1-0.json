It has been just over two years since we <a href=\"https://spring.io/blog/2020/04/15/announcing-the-spring-authorization-server\">initially announced</a> this new project, and we have come a long way since its initial development. The project has a full <a href=\"https://docs.spring.io/spring-authorization-server/docs/current/reference/html/overview.html#feature-list\">feature set</a>, and the APIs have stabilized and matured over this time. A lot of effort and care was put into this project to ensure that it can grow and adapt over the next few years.</p> \n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\"> \n <p>Spring Authorization Server 1.0 will be based on Spring Security 6.0, which will be based off of <a href=\"https://spring.io/blog/2021/09/02/a-java-17-and-jakarta-ee-9-baseline-for-spring-framework-6\">Spring Framework 6.0</a> and will require a minimum of Java 17 at runtime, as well as a minimum of Tomcat 10 or Jetty 11 (for Jakarta EE 9 compatibility). This major release will inherit the <a href=\"https://tanzu.vmware.com/support/oss\">VMware Tanzu OSS support policy</a>. <a href=\"https://tanzu.vmware.com/spring-runtime\">Commercial support</a>, which offers an extended support period, is also available from VMware.</p> \n</div>\n" ],
