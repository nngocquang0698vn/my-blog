    "summary" : [ "For anyone who is considering it for their own org, I shifted my org to a four day workweek several months ago, just as others globally are starting to (including, civil servants in Scotland!)\n\n100% endorse. We are getting the same amount of work done because we are less bored, stressed and tired. We all take off Fridays. Everyoneâ€™s pay remained the same.\n\nSome people use the time for a paid second gig. Others to volunteer or like me, to read a book with a cat snuggled near by. \n\n#4dayworkweek" ],
