For some, your dog is terrier through and through! In today’s podcast, we are talking terriers and every dog that may struggle with movement such as cars, ankles, other dogs and other furry animals, and so much more. They also struggle with over-excitement, being handled, restrained, and more. Terriers can be less forgiving in training, and yet there’s a game for that! </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a terrier and that includes those bully breed terriers like the Amstaff, or a dog with an inner terrier, check out our Absolute Terrier badge. Many happy owners of Huskies, Collies, Mixed Breeds, and more have already expressed delight at the content of the Absolute Terrier badge. Jump into today… and if it’s not terrier, don’t worry – we have so many other online training courses available right now, all 40% off for a limited time. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Get Absolute Terrier here: <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://absolute-dogs.com/products/absolute-terrier\" target=\"_blank\">https://absolute-dogs.com/products/absolute-terrier</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.thesexierthanasquirrelchallenge.com/sexier-than-a-squirrel-2-01618522334883\" target=\"_blank\">Support the show</a> (https://www.thesexierthanasquirrelchallenge.com/sexier-than-a-squirrel-2-01618522334883)</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>**OFFER ONLY VALID 26TH DECEMBER 2021 – 1ST JANUARY 2022**</strong></p>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<!-- Do the right sidebar check -->\n\t\t\t\n\n\t<div class=\"col-lg-4 widget-area\" id=\"podcast-sidebar\">\n<aside id=\"block-11\" class=\"widget widget_block\">\n<div class=\"plume-widget-outer\">\n\t\n\t<div class=\"plume-widget-inner text-center px-md-4 py-3 pb-4 px-3\">\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<div class=\"widget-image mb-3\">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img width=\"580\" height=\"328\" src=\"https://absolutedogs-images.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/2022/09/widget-1-580x328.png\" class=\"attachment-widget-image-size size-widget-image-size\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"\" sizes=\"(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px\">\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<h2>Welcome to <strong>Absolute Dogs</strong></h2>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<div class=\"widget-description\">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tOnline Dog Training Games.
