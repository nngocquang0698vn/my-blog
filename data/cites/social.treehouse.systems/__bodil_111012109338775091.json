    "summary" : [ "Ok, I cracked last night and upgraded my Starfield preorder so I could play it two days early. Not because I was terribly excited about it but because I couldn't stand not knowing whether it was a good game or not. And, well, I've put about two hours into it and it's honestly the most uninspired, unoriginal game I've played in a long time, the voice acting is bad, the writing is worse, the gameplay for the most part is Fallout 4 exactly and after 700 hours logged I'm a little done with Fallout 4, the space flight bit is like a less polished version of No Man's Sky except you can't fly down onto planets seamlessly—in 2023!—and the 3D engine has my GPU struggling above 90C with fans going like jet engines at medium settings where NMS easily stays below 80C at max settings and looks better at any setting, and I've already had one thermal shutdown event in addition to multiple crashes to desktop. So, basically, typical AAA game launch, will probably revisit in a couple of months when I'm in the mood for it and maybe it's less broken but right now the new NMS update sounds a lot more appealing.\n\nSo, everyone going \"it's Skyrim meets No Man's Sky,\" I don't know what you've been smoking, it's literally just Fallout 4 in space, and as far as space goes it's nothing like NMS, or even Mass Effect, just another tired Outer Worlds style rehash of the same tired SF clichés. Well, I suppose if you liked Outer Worlds you'll probably like this one too, in the same way a lot of people enjoy eating at McDonald's. It's just, with Baldur's Gate 3 so fresh in mind I guess I've come to expect a little more." ],
