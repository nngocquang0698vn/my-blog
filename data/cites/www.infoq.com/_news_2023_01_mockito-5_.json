    "summary" : [ "Mockito has released version 5, switching the default mockmaker to mockito-inline in order to better support future versions of the JDK and allows mocking of constructors, static methods and final classes out of the box. The baseline increased from Java 8 to Java 11, as supporting both versions became costly and managing changes in the JDK such as with the SecurityManager proved difficult." ],
