    "summary" : [ "When using Postman, itâ€™s a best practice to store API token values in environment secret variables. Environment variables can also be used to store other variables uses in scripts. But when opening a collection, we often forget to select an environment and spend a few seconds if not minutes or more trying to figure out what the problem is with a request. Just to realize in the end that we just forgot to select an environment. How can this be avoided?" ],
