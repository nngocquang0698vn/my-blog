    "summary" : [ "Big public companies that rose up on the back of the free, open web over the last 20y want to wall it off, make it proprietary.\n\nOf course they do. They benefited from openness on the way up, but now they ARE the incumbents they previously disrupted, they want to stop others doing the same to them. We cheer for plucky upstarts, but then they simply become what they railed against. \n\nThe answer is always openness, all the time. And flipping the bird to incumbents, even if they used to be cool." ],
