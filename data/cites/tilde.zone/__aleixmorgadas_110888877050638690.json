    "summary" : [ "What I do love from #pairing is that the lag between you evolve your mental model about the problem at hand, and you are able to communicate that to another team member is the shortest one.\n\nI can learn new stuff from the domain within minutes with a fast feedback loop as you gain when doing #TDD for example.\n\nBut the important aspect is about how much time lapses between that little learning you had and the whole team is up to date to the enhanced model.\n\nThat's why pairing + TDD is a super powerful combination of methodologies. Nowadays, if you combine with remote collaboration tools as #Miro, you are able to capture those learnings in a shared board that other colleagues can check in a regular basis." ],
