    "summary" : [ "I remain completely fascinated by the way programmers develop physical metaphors for the abstract work we do, in our heads. And how much sense those metaphors make for us.\n\nI was just thinking about stack unwinding and how I have a pretty good concept in my head of \"throwing\" something up a stack that gets \"caught\" dynamically somewhere else (as opposed to a lexical unwind/break).\n\nLike, how did my brain even develop these metaphors in the first place? It's so weird and so cool. I love programming." ],
