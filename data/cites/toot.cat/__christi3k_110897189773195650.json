    "summary" : [ "Reading through HN (I know, I know) about the #HashiCorp licensing change. Lots of folks get the rug pull and why it’s so shitty to the open source community. Folks defending HC, too.\n\nI’m just thinking about all the conferences who accepted talks about HC products only because they were open source. That’s free marketing. On the backbone of the open source community. Blessed with a certain kind of legitimacy. (Many conferences simple won’t accept “vendor” talks either at all or outside of paid slots.)\n\nI really hope open source conferences are pulling any accepted talks now that the licenses have changed. HC has fundamentally changed how DevRel needs to work at the company now. No longer able to pretend it’s about serving the OSS community." ],
