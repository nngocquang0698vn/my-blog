And I understand that Twitter have screwed them over. And I'm sure that they're a thoroughly trustworthy company who will never get hacked. But asking customers to fatally compromise their own security like that is <em>not</em> acceptable.</p><h2 id=\"cant-you-just\"><a href=\"https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2023/07/please-dont-give-away-your-twitter-api-keys-to-cloudinary/#cant-you-just\" class=\"heading-link\">Can't you just...?</a></h2><p>Twitter doesn't offer a <strong>stable</strong> avatar service. Users can change their profile picture at any time, and the URl to the old image stops working. So caching the profile picture URl often leads to a broken image.  Caching an old image can mean showing something outdated.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/users/lookup/api-reference/get-users-by-username-username\">API rate limits</a> are pretty small for any service with heavy traffic.</p><p>Not showing a user image - or just the Twitter icon - <em>could</em> work. But it makes for a pretty crappy experience.</p><p>Telling everyone to leave Twitter and join Mastodon would be nice.</p><p>Creating a bespoke read-only API key could work - but Twitter now limits the number of apps a develop can have unless they pay stupid money.</p><p>It is entirely understandable that people would panic and hand over the keys to their (digital) kingdom. Fear makes people do dangerous things.</p><p>Anyway, this Mastodon post sums it up the best:</p><p><iframe data-lazyloaded=\"1\" src=\"about:blank\"

Unfortunately I don't have an ETA on when such a solution might be available, however we will do our best to keep you updated.\nI understand that they don't want users to have a degraded experience. And I understand that Twitter have screwed them over. And I'm sure that they're a thoroughly trustworthy company who will never get hacked. But asking customers to fatally compromise their own security like that is not acceptable.Can't you just...?\nTwitter doesn't offer a stable avatar service. Users can change their profile picture at any time, and the URl to the old image stops working. So caching the profile picture URl often leads to a broken image. Caching an old image can mean showing something outdated.\nThe API rate limits are pretty small for any service with heavy traffic.\nNot showing a user image - or just the Twitter icon - could work. But it makes for a pretty crappy experience.\nTelling everyone to leave Twitter and join Mastodon would be nice.\nCreating a bespoke read-only API key could work - but Twitter now limits the number of apps a develop can have unless they pay stupid money.\nIt is entirely understandable that people would panic and hand over the keys to their (digital) kingdom. Fear makes people do dangerous things.\nAnyway, this Mastodon post sums it up the best:\nShare this post on… Mastodon Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Reddit HackerNews Lobsters Pocket WhatsApp Telegram",
