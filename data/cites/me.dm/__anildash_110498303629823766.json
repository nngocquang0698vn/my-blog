    "summary" : [ "Just got (unsolicited!) an email of an essay from Marc Andreessen that is clearly meant to be his definitive statement on AI, akin to his \"software eating the world\" polemic, and it is so _stupid_, so willfully intellectually dishonest, that anyone who reports on it, or reacts to it, with anything other than dismissal is either a fool or complicit in his explicitly authoritarian agenda. The guy who is explicitly in favor of colonialism is... still in favor of colonialism. Fuck that." ],
