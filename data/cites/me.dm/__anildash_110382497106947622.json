    "summary" : [ "Attached: 4 images\n\nA year ago, I was honored with a lifetime achievement award by the Webbys. I was a little too distracted to properly celebrate it at the time (Glitch was acquired about 48 hrs later) but it was a fun party and we got to dress up and hang out with new friends and old. I said at the time it was the bookend to a certain era of my life and my career, and in retrospect that’s clearly true. I’m grateful to be in the next chapter." ],
