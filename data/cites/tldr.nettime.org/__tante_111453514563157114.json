    "summary" : [ "Sam Altman is back as OpenAI CEO with a new board.\n\nAnd of course the new board was hand picked to no longer restrict Altman so he can run OpenAI as a business as he sees fit (until he jumps to one of his own things he's been preparing for months now).\n\nThe interesting aspect of this: The new board no longer has any women, the 2 women on the old board were replaced by Larry Summers who's known to think that women just have less \"intrinsic aptitude\" for \"science and engineering\". So Yeah. Says a lot about what OpenAI considers important." ],
