    "summary" : [ "I have interviewed 100s of candidates for software engineering positions. \n\nI’ve done take-home tests, in person challenges, pair programming with the candidates. \n\nAll of them were awful experiences for me and especially for the candidate. \n\nI can only think of a single instance where a code challenge exposed a poor software engineer and I could definitely have made the same assessment just by talking to them. \n\nLately I’ve stopped doing any software or mental puzzles. \n\nI don’t do any of that when I interview designers or QA people or HR people, so why would I be particularly toxic towards software engineers during the hiring process?\n\nInstead, I actually read their resumes (which is significantly quicker than doing interviews, asking them to repeat the same information), and then I ask them questions like:\n\n- Where do you get your tech news?\n- How do you learn about new technologies?\n- What do you most appreciate in your coworkers today?\n- What is a perfect workday like for you?\n\nI specifically avoid trap-style questions like “what is your greatest weakness?” or “why are you leaving your current job?”\n\nI recommend that you make a plan for what you want to learn about the candidate, e.g. “are they good at acquiring new skills?” or “do they share the same values as the team?” and then structure the interview around that. \n\nBe a non-toxic manager. Make your company look good during the interview process. Get better candidates.\n\n#jobs" ],
