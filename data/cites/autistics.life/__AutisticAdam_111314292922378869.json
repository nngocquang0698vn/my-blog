    "summary" : [ "When people invite you to dinner/movie.. the chances are the activity is just an excuse to meet up and the real objective is to socialise. I find this endearing, for years I didnâ€™t know this.\n\nI used to automatically assume that the suggested activity was the *main* purpose of a meet-up. I thought an invitation to dinner meant that the predominant point of focus was the FOOD, or an invitation to watch a movie meant the MOVIE was the centrepiece of the night.\n\n@actuallyautistic@a.gup.pe #actuallyautistic" ],
