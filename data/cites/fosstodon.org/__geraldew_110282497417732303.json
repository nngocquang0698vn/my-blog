    "summary" : [ "FOSS licenses come in two approaches. The distinction is  _who_ is granted the most freedom:\n\n- in \"copyleft\" licenses the emphasis is on the end-user, ensuring that they are _always_ passed the four freedoms;\n\n- in \"permissive\" licenses, the emphasis is on other developers/programmers, including allowing them to _not_ pass on the four freedoms.\n\nIs disappointing people still mistake this as being a difference between #FreeSoftware and #OpenSource because each has always supported both types." ],
