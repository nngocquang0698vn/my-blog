But ChatGPT recommended it to me because it requires the least force to actuate the keys, and the travel distance is okay. Which is not the case with all mech keyboards?\n\nNever used one ever in my life. Apparently, they're supposed to be good for gaming too? It's an investment? So I find myself here wondering if I should stick with a regular, scissor switch or so (love them!) â€” or go for these much more expensive options." ],
