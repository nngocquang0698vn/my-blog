    "summary" : [ "I'm open to being wrong, but for my money, \"identify as\"/\"identifies as\" is almost always a useless phrase.\n\n\"She identifies as a woman\" => \"She is a woman.\"\n\n\"They identify as Catholic.\" => \"They are Catholic.\"\n\nAnd so forth. The only utility I can see is to distance the act of identification from actual belonging (as in the classic journalistic twist, \"Name Lastname, who identifies as non-binary, [proceeds to misgender them]\"), or to discuss the fallibility of survey results (\"well, 50% of the cohort identified as sanitation workers, but it's possibly because you said 'garbage people' instead\").\n\nIn my opinion, it's just not a phrase you should use, unless you can articulate why a simple \"is\" or \"are\" doesn't work." ],
