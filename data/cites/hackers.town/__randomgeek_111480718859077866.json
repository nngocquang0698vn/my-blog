I say \"cognitive resources\" instead to describe my similar but not identical #ADHD issues.\n\nBut maybe I can have a little fun with it. What about \"Spork Theory?\"\n\nI've got an entire damn drawer of resources, but they're individually wrapped, not reusable, not well-suited to any one task, and break if you try too hard." ],
