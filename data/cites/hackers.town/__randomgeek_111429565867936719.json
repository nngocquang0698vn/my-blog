But it has a noticeable pause when switching, so I have a second keyboard for when I'm mid-sentence in work stuff and want to toot or something.\n\nAnd in the evening I get silly and have both on the personal system. Primary types better, secondary has better media controls.\n\nAnd very occasionally I get confused, start typing on one, and finish typing on the other." ],
