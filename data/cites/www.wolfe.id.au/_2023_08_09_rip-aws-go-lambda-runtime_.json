    "summary" : [ "Amazon Web Services (AWS) is deprecating the go1.x runtime on Lambda, this is currently scheduled for December 31, 2023. Customers need to migrate their Go based lambda functions to the al2.provided runtime, which uses Amazon Linux 2 as the execution environment. I think this is a bad thing for a couple of reasons:\nThere is no automated migration path from existing Go Lambda functions to the new custom runtime. Customers will need to manually refactor and migrate each function to this new runtime, which this is time-consuming and error-prone." ],
