It’s important to remember—someone will read your website. A tweet is dead on the vine. No one is gonna read your old Facebook note from years ago. But your website is timeless and someone will eventually read it.\n\nMaking your own website is rewarding in a way that a corporate social media profile never will be.\n\nhttps://andy-bell.co.uk/just-post/" ],
