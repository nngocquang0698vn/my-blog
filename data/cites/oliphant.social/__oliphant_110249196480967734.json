    "summary" : [ "So how does Mastodon pay its engineers?\n\nMostly...it doesn't. Eugen and Claire are the only paid devs on Mastodon.\n\nEveryone else is making updates *for free*, as a hobby, on the side, after their day job.\n\nPeople are building CalcKey for free. People are building just about every fediverse product for free, as part of the open source community.\n\nIt was particularly amusing when Elon said he wanted to open source the algorithm--\n\nJack Dorsey saying he wanted to create an open source protocol--\n\nNearly all of the Fediverse is open source. The algorithms are already open source. The protocol is a W3C standard (ActivityPub) just like HTML.\n\nThe future these dopes have been trying to build already exists.\n\nThere's just no money or power in it for them, so they have no interest and pretend it doesn't exist." ],
