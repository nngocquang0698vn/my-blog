    "summary" : [ "i have outright deleted a major patchset i wrote for a project under freedesktop.org stewardship, which someone else is probably going to write again in a year or two, because i realized the project had a real-name policy, and decided it wasn't worth it. i then lost motivation for the cool thing i was working on that needed me to write that patch\n\nthis is not the intended effect of a \"real-name\" policy, but it is the actual effect. and, as the cool kids say, \"the system is what it does\".\n\nthere is no such thing as a \"real name\". the concept of a \"legal name\" is fraught, and most certainly is not what you think it is, or what you are looking for, if you are a software developer. many assumptions you have about what a \"legal name\" is probably are not true.\n\nconsider this: the name on my birth certificate is different than the name on my drivers license, and that is different from the names i am called by my friends. those names are all different from what is likely to be on my passport when i get it, and all of those are different than the name i publish my open source projects under. all of these, in different jurisdictions, might or might not be something you could consider a \"legal name\". which one do you want me to use when i submit a major feature to your library? are you going to turn me away if i try to submit it as \"linear cannon\"? why? if i have a website and contact information under that name, why does this matter? how is it substantially different than an author of fiction novels publishing under a pen name? does it change if i produce a piece of government-issued documentation with that name on it? why, or why not?\n\nif your real name policy does not answer these questions adequately, then there's a very good chance i'm just going to assume that you're going to turn me away, as has happened to me several times already\n\nRE: it would be nice if it were actually as easy to contribute to free/open source software as the developers and maintainers of such software claim it is\n\nbut meritocracy is a lie, and bullshit policies and procedures (see: \"real name\" policy) scare away minorities who might otherwise do important work" ],
