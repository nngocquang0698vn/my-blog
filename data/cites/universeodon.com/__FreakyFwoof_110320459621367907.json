    "summary" : [ "Attached: 1 image\n\nToday I am disappointed and disgusted to say that #WesternDigital have sent me an email that has very important content in it, but it's inaccessible.\nThey've suffered a data breach, but the information about said breach has been put into the email as an image.\nA #ScreenReader user without some level of tech knowledge would be unable to read that, and may actually think it's spam. To us, it goes straight to the line that says 'Copyright 2023 Western Digital' and skips all the salient points.\nUtterly disgusting behaviour from such a large company about such an important topic.\nIf you're of a mind to do so, please boost to raise awareness.\nThis email is seemingly *not* a drill." ],
