    "summary" : [ "- 7.2% of American adults are LGBTQ. That's 18.9 million adults, or larger than the entire veteran population.\n- 11 million Americans are bisexual. That's more people than the entire state of Georgia.\n- 3.6 million Americans are gay. That's more than the entire state of Utah.\n- 2.6 million Americans are lesbian. That's more people than every single farmer in the country.\n- and 1.6 million of us are transgender. That's TWICE as many as there are cops in the entire United States.\n\nWhen people say \"we shouldn't change our entire society just to pander to such a small percentage of it\", that's obviously a really dumb argument from just an ethical stance. But it's also a really dishonest one. Because they would never say the same thing about veterans, farmers, cops, or the populations of entire States." ],
