    "summary" : [ "It maybe sounds obvious, but if there's one thing I learned from years building open source social platforms, it's this: very few people care about the ideology of your product. The only thing that matters to them is whether it fits their need - there's no way of shirking the responsibility to build the best possible solution. Ideology might (and should) matter to *you*. But it's not a replacement for being usable." ],
