    "summary" : [ "Extra special ❤️ to my fellow high functioners. \n\nThere’s nothing easy about grinding to a halt, but there’s also a special kind of hell for people who continue to function and seem normal. \n\nIt feels like drowning in plain sight.\n\nAnd on that note, the phrase “it’s OK not to be OK” can pop itself right in the sea as far as I’m concerned.\n\nTolerance of poor mental health is bare minimum.\n\nBeing not OK isn’t OK. People don’t need “permission” to be in that place, they need to be helped out of it." ],
