    "summary" : [ "Back when Raquel VÃ©lez was my boss at npm, inc., she had a name for when somebody would give you an ill-defined task and then would get upset when you didn't do it \"right.\"\n\nShe called it \"Bring me a rock.\" When I asked her what that meant, she would say \"Bring me a rock... no, not that one.\" It was a pretty clear example.\n\nShe recognized quickly that I hate, with all of me, \"Bring me a rock.\" It's the least good game.\n\nAnyway, was thinking about that tonight.\n\nEverybody should use that." ],
