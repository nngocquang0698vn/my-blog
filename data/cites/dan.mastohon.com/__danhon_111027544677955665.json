    "summary" : [ "Life is short. Use the fancy olive oil and the special salt. Drink the expensive wine and the fine spirits you've been saving. Get out the nice plates you're worried will break. Buy the guillotine you've had your eye on. Stake out and learn the routines of billionaires. Blow that rainy day money on turning inside sources. Don't waste your life on what-ifs. Behead them all and let the revolution sing." ],
