I have an autistic+ADHD pal who needs support and adjustments made in how they work (e.g. better ways of tracking hours, trouble with being interrupted during a task, looming existential dread at unplanned meetings and most of all difficulty articulating needs) and it would be great to send them something they can show their manager." ],
