Post good content. Be a good human. Or just hang out and enjoy good content and good humans. Follow people to get good content. Follow as many people as are sharing interesting content, because thatâ€™s how content gets into your feed. ðŸ˜‡ You are free to be.\n\n#Migration #Engagement #Mastodon #FediTips" ],
