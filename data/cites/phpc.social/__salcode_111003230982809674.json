I hadn't considered that the output of `git push --force` includes the old commit hash - good to know!\n\nOne suggestion, instead of `git push --force`, perhaps you'd consider using `git push --force-with-lease` instead\n\nIn my experience, `--force-with-lease` is nearly always a better option.\n\nI've even written my notes about it at https://salferrarello.com/never-git-push-force/\n\nThanks!" ],
