    "summary" : [ "There was a time in my life when I was working on open source, like, every weeknight and weekend. I was contributing to tools I used as well as my own OSS projects. Just firing on all cylinders.\n\nAfter a few years I got super burned out (https://nolanlawson.com/2017/03/05/what-it-feels-like-to-be-an-open-source-maintainer/). These days I kind of feel like my weekends and evenings are sacred. I file bugs on browsers and OSS projects constantly, but I usually do it as part of my 9-to-5.\n\nContributing to the commons is a noble cause, but man is it tiring." ],
