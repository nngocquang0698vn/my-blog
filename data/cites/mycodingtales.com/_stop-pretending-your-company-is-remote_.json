    "summary" : [ "The pandemic made evident how much work can, and should, be different. The forced change to accommodate remote workflows also brought to light what I like to call “virtual offices”. Unlike truly remote friendly workplaces optimized for asynchronous communication, these aim to merely transport the office into a virtual space keeping the same unnecessary constraints of synchronous work intact, only replacing shoulder taps with Zoom calls. I’d love if we collectively agreed to start using a more appropriate name for these. They are office-less companies but they are not remote-friendly." ],
