Every\nSaga Has A Beginning.</p>\n\n  <p>&#x2013; Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace, Trailer</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The first step (commit) for RuboCop was quite <a href=\"https://github.com/rubocop/rubocop/commit/afbead34db54506c12a21dbd4ce04fada0f8b9a4\">modest</a>. Back then I knew next to nothing about parsers, lexers, abstract syntax trees and all that jazz. I recall I planned to implement RuboCop in terms of regular expressions&#x2026; I remember I had the idea about the project for quite a while, but really struggled to come up with a name that I liked. Picking the name is probably the hardest part of every project and this was certainly true with RuboCop.</p>\n\n<p>The journey that followed was epic and\nbeyond anything I could have ever imagined:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>11,431 commits</li>\n  <li>4,384 closed issues</li>\n  <li>5,803 merged pull requests</li>\n  <li>201 releases</li>\n  <li>800+ contributors</li>\n  <li>220+ million downloads</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>That&#x2019;s an average rate of 20 releases per year over the course of an entire decade! I can think of no moment in\ntime when RuboCop had stagnated and the development wasn&#x2019;t moving at a brisk pace.</p>\n\n<p>As I write this RuboCop is at #82 in the <a href=\"https://rubygems.org/stats\">list of most downloaded Ruby gems</a>!\nA project that I&#x2019;ve started with very modest goals became extremely popular within\nour Ruby community. Impossible is nothing, right? For me RuboCop is the very embodiment of the power of open-source software and open-source communities.\nDid you know that today there are over 250 third-party RuboCop-related gems on RubyGems(extensions, configuration, etc)?</p>\n\n<p>This won&#x2019;t be a long article about the history of RuboCop. I&#x2019;m way too lazy to write one, plus I already spoke a few times about the (early) history of the project in the past.<sup id=\"fnref:1\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"https://metaredux.com/posts/2022/04/21/rubocop-turns-10.html#fn:1\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a></sup> This won&#x2019;t be a long article at all. Just a small celebration of RuboCop&#x2019;s 10th anniversary. I don&#x2019;t know about you, but to me 10 years in software is like 50 years in some other industry. Maybe even more.</p>\n\n<p>I&#x2019;m extremely proud of the RuboCop journey so far and all of our small victories along the way. I&#x2019;m proud of the community that has formed around RuboCop and of the <a href=\"https://docs.rubocop.org/rubocop/about/team.html\">RuboCop Core Team</a> members that have been essential to its long-term success. I&#x2019;m proud of all of the lessons that I learned along the way. I&#x2019;m proud of all the challenges that we overcame together. There were many moments when I was ready to throw in the towel and call it a day, but somehow I managed to pull threw. Working on a project of such scale can be extremely emotionally draining.</p>\n\n<p>I know that RuboCop has become a very polarizing project in the community. In surveys it&#x2019;s often near the top in both &#x201C;the most loved Ruby tool&#x201D; and &#x201C;the most hated Ruby tool&#x201D; categories. Some people have told me that RuboCop played a part in their decision to stop doing Ruby. Admittedly we might have gone overboard at times in our desire to improve Ruby codebases.<sup id=\"fnref:2\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"https://metaredux.com/posts/2022/04/21/rubocop-turns-10.html#fn:2\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">2</a></sup> We&#x2019;ve been accused of destroying some of the fun of programming by imposing too many rules. I guess there&#x2019;s some truth to this.</p>\n\n<p>But we&#x2019;ve always listened to our community - a few years ago we promised that with RuboCop 1.0 backward compatibility would become a top priority and we kept our word.\nWe promised that we&#x2019;d limit the work that people need to do on upgrades and we kept our word. We always listen and your feedback is always welcome!</p>\n\n<p>Anyways, back to the celebration! To commemorate this glorious occasion we&#x2019;ve just released <a href=\"https://github.com/rubocop/rubocop/releases/tag/v1.28.0\">RuboCop 1.28</a>, aka &#x201C;RuboCop: The Anniversary Edition&#x201D;.

Clearly there are always things to improve and we definitely have a few ideas about the journey to RuboCop 2.0:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Make RuboCop significantly faster (e.g. 2 times faster than it currently is). Think of it as our version of Ruby 3x3.</li>\n  <li>Organize cops into some &#x201C;presets&#x201D; that would address the common complaint that RuboCop checks for way too many things out of the box.

It&#x2019;s not like you can&#x2019;t do this today, but probably shipping this out-of-the-box would simplify the setup for many people. There are plenty of interesting ideas to explore in this direction.</li>\n  <li>Internal consistency. Make the configuration uniform and more intuitive across the board. I have to admit that in the early days of RuboCop I didn&#x2019;t think much about configuration consistency, which was a major mistake on my part.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I&#x2019;m confident that regardless of the exact details RuboCop has another bright decade ahead of it. I can only hope that I&#x2019;ll be able to see it through. When I&#x2019;ve started the project I was 27 years old, today I&#x2019;m 37. Time flies really fast. When I was younger I was quite skeptical I&#x2019;d be able to be an effective programmer after the age of 40, knowing how dynamic our industry is and how things are constantly changing. Still, I love programming just as much as I always did, I love working on open-source projects as much as I always did and I&#x2019;m cautiously optimistic about powering through another decade of fun OSS adventures.</p>\n\n<p>And that&#x2019;s a wrap!
