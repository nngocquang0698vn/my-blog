    "summary" : [ "\"i use linux as my operating system,\" i state proudly to the unkempt, bearded man. he swivels around in his desk chair with a devilish gleam in his eyes, ready to mansplain with extreme precision.\n\"actually,\" he says with a grin, \"linux is just the kernel. you use GNU+linux.\"\ni don't miss a beat and reply with a smirk, \"i use alpine, a distro that doesn't include the GNU coreutils, or any other GNU code. it's linux, but it's not GNU+linux.\"\n\nthe smile quickly drops from the man's face. his body begins convulsing and he foams at the mouth as he drop to the floor with a sickly thud. as he writhes around he screams \"I-IT WAS COMPILED WITH GCC! THAT MEANS IT'S STILL GNU!\"\ncoolly, i reply \"if windows was compiled with gcc, would that make it GNU?\" i interrupt his response with \"and work is being made on the kernel to make it more compiler-agnostic. even if you were correct, you won't be for long.\"\n\nwith a sickly wheeze, the last of the man's life is ejected from his body. he lies on the floor, cold and limp. i've womansplained him to death." ],
