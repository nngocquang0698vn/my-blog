    "summary" : [ "This is just another reminder to me that when some people start banging the “free speech” drum, you’re only really free to say sentiments preapproved by the establishment. It’s also easily observed that the people who *say* facts don’t care about feelings consistently and ruthlessly prioritise their discomfort (read: feelings) and use that as feeble justification to reject the facts.\n\nSome of you wonder why people like myself couldn’t see you as anything other than a bad-faith actor you present yourselves to be." ],
