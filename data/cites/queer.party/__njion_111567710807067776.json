    "summary" : [ "I really dislike the common line of reasoning that \"being gay/trans isn't wrong because they were born this way/it's not a choice\". That's not why it isn't wrong. It isn't wrong because it doesn't cause any harm to anyone. If being gay was a choice it'd be just as okay morally! \nThis is important because sexual attraction and gender identity can naturally change over the course of one's life. Under the framework of \"it's only ok if they're born like this\" that can be seen as problematic. It forces people to stay quiet about their experiences if their identity changes at all and especially if some external factor is a catalyst for that. And so what if it is? What if some experience \"made you bi\"? There's still nothing wrong with that!" ],
