    "summary" : [ "In conversation w a friend, she was surprised when I said we won't have electricity after social collapse. She asked \"why? What happens to electricity?\"\n\nI had to then explain that infrastructure needs people to maintain and if things fall apart, nobody will keep the generators going or the wires in check. She seemed surprised by this. \n\nIs this why people don't seem worried about what's coming? They have no idea???\n\nI was trying to hide my shock that I had to explain this to someone who isn't a child. I think I take too much for granted and assume too much of people's ability to be logical.\n\nNow her obsession with social issues at the expense of #ClimateCrisis makes sense. I was always wondering how someone on the left would not care about collapse. I have tried to explain before that as much as I share her concerns about the many dire issues that do need dealing with, none of it matters if climate change causes collapse. Then we won't have social housing, or equity, or any of the other things she cares about. (she was even part of a group that protested demanding \"affordable gas\") \n\nHer look of shock finally helped me realize that she has absolutely no idea what #ClimateCollapse means. No idea. I've been arguing with her all these years and she's had no idea. \n\nI don't even know what to say. \n\nThere's no way she's the only one. Lots of well intentioned people say \"yes climate is important but....\".\n\nI am here to tell you that none of those other issues will even exist in the face of climate and social collapse. \n\nI don't know if the average person can even image the number of deaths that we are facing when the society we built loses electricity." ],
