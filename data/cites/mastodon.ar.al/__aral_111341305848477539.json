Not surprising, since we haven’t had a single successful funding application and I’m done wasting my time with this crap.\n\nsmall-web.org will launch as a commercial service (host your own Small Web place for ~€10/mo) and hopefully that will make Small Technology Foundation sustainable. Since everything we do is free and open, others will also be able to host Small Web places.\n\nAlso, you can fund us directly: https://small-tech.org/fund-us" ],
