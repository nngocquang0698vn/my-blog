    "summary" : [ "In software engineering I tend to have a rule that if a lot of your senior engineers don’t buy into an practice, pattern or tool, you should reflect over forcing it. \n\nThey’re smart people who are probably not resistant for fun, but because they don’t see the benefits you do.\n\nThere may be a couple of ways to shift the debate if after reflection you think it is still important to drive the idea." ],
