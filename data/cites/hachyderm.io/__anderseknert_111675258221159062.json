    "summary" : [ "2023 was a decent year for me. With the kids now 1 and 3 I think I finally started to realize I’m a dad (!!) with all the responsibilities that come with that, and I started to adapt (way less travel, etc). Professionally, I’m really happy with what me and @charlieegan3 have accomplished during quite a turbulent year. And of course #Regal, the linter for #Rego that I started work on in January, and which now has a small community of users and contributors. Happy new year everyone! 🥂❤️" ],
