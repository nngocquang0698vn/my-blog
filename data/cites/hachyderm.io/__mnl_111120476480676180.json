I have a hard time gauging when sensory nuisances impact my stress level, so went with wearing ear protection as much as possible. \n\nI intentionally wore the big yellow gun range protectors not just to make it easier to find me, but to more openly show that wearing ear protection is a thing. Had I known it earlier, many conferences would have been much easier to attend.\n\n1/" ],
