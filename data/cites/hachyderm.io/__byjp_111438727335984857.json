Adding machine readable event tags to pages like this: https://www.ewanbleach.com/events)\n\nor something more fancy, like letting me attach (#ipvm runnable?) WASM to that page that will extract an iCal file.\n\nI want to make microformats and standard metadata more available without everyone having to get on board." ],
