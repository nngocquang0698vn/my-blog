    "summary" : [ "This whole conference debacle is so disappointing. Speakers, when invited to a conf will say “who alls gonna be there?” I’ve my rules for participation posted on my site - including an inclusive lineup - for years. I was duped by the fake speakers also.\n\nI remind all conf organizers that there are THOUSANDS of speakers of all walks of life, genders, ages, backgrounds. I offer 920 for you to invite to your confs http://hanselminutes.com/episodes inclusion means doing the work. So, do the work, friends." ],
