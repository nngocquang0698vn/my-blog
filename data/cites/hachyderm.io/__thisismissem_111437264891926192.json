    "summary" : [ "So the thing I don't get about tumblr is why it's so strict on anything remotely sexual, yet happily broadcasts and pushes ads with graphic violent content of people being shot in a video game.\n\nTo me, I find violence 100x worse for society than something mildly sexually explicit. It's deeply saddening just how normalised violence is in our society, but sex is so taboo." ],
