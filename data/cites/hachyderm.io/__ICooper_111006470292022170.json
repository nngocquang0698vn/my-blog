I worked on the project when it started, and one decision we made was to store ADRs for design decisions local to the project within the repo\n\nTwo years later, re-reading these is really helping me get up to speed on why some things work the way they do. In particular we had a mob exploration of the codespace and questions popped up which were answered by these ADRs." ],
