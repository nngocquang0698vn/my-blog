Does the copy for doing so use the phrases “forget”, “remember”, or otherwise suggesting that people should store the password to your site in their heads?\n\nYou should change that. It’s ableist and doesn’t reflect good practices.\n\nAnd while you’re changing it, you should remove any *hint* of shaming around the process. Shit happens, and passwords need to be reset." ],
