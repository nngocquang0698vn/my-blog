    "summary" : [ "One of my favorite tools in my productivity toolbox for getting started on things I don’t particularly feel like doing is the inverse pomodoro. It’s basically what it sounds like: a timed work/break cycle, but the work and break times are reversed from a normal pomodoro. I usually set a 5 minute timer, do some work, and then do something relaxing or fun for 15 minutes. I usually find that after doing that once or twice, it’s pretty easy to flip to normal pomodoros." ],
