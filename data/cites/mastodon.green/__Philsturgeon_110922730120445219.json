It's not being maintained (some upstream dependencies) but even the name is out of date. Thankfully the #Redocly CLI does everything it did, but better, so I recommend you go use that. \n\nMore deprecations of old #OpenAPI tooling to come as I find more viable modern alternatives. \n\n#APIDesign #APIDevelopment #OpenSource \nhttps://www.npmjs.com/package/@redocly/cli" ],
