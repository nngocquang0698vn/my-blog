    "summary" : [ "I don't know how to convince more workers in tech that we need unions. We sorely do and I'm hoping that the strikes are showing why. That's why I can't wait for @beep@follow.ethanmarcotte.com's book about tech unions at https://abookapart.com/products/you-deserve-a-tech-union to come out. It's cheaper than an O'Reilly subscription and will put you into what will make the industry and the industries we touch so much better." ],
