This is really what I'm afraid of. And I'm stupid findable on the Web (thanks to not using an alias — that bit me in the ass very fast — like in 2013, but whatever).\n\nI'm hoping Cher wins this case; I'll be following it closely. Especially because I've applied like four times at Mozilla with not as much as a reply if the role was closed or anything. Sidenote, though, I hate the fact that's this idea that we can sign away rights because we have a contract — and that's never clear if it's actually the case. I really am glad she stood up.
