That lack of knowledge reduces my pressure to \"make more like that\" and allows me to just flow.\n\nWith my website, that's also something I'll be able to discern since I have privacy respecting analytics. I'm tempted to remove that as well and use semantic engagement (likes, boosts) as such a metric.\n\nOr or or, I could just keep doing what I want." ],
