Fuck the people who hadn't pushed against this and kept up this long battle of the digital attention economy through ads. I'm not terribly forgiving of those in favor of digital advertisment's rise — any business that requires nonconsentual engagement (and uses it to remain as profitable as possible) is unethical.\n\nSurveillance capitalism is one of the grossest things to exist and despite it being coined recently, that shit is old. As old as overseers. https://infosec.exchange/@catsalad/111426154930652642 (https://jacky.wtf/2023/11/4xxP)" ],
