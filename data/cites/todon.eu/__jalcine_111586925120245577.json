    "summary" : [ "Stop defending companies as if they're people in 2024.\n\nI'm begging you please. Just because the government treats them with personhood doesn't mean you have to. Legality of a concept does not equate to its morality.\n\nEdit: I was not asking for peoples' opinion on corporate personhood. This was some of y'all first interaction with me so imma add a disclaimer (and reminder to read): \"legality of a concept does not equate to its morality\". Meaning even with laws of personhood, people aren't considered HUMANS. Closest to a measurable object by which the law is prejudiously applied to.\n\nI swear, the first feature I'm making for my site when I add AP support is disabling replies." ],
