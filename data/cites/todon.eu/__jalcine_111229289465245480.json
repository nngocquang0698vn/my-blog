And now I'll be alienating myself from anyone who plays on there. I still have my 360 (and a bunch of games to play on) so I'll keep that but I'll probably look to homebrew it so I can pull my stats into a SQLite database somewhere.\n\nI'm at the point now where I care a lot less if I \"miss out\". It'll be on Steam (because PC gaming - though still a cliff, once climbed - brings it to everyone) or GOG or what have you. I'm putting my faith into PC gaming, too. It's what got me into gaming (on library computers) and it's what keeps me interested.\n\nNever had a PlayStation so never had to worry about that. (https://jacky.wtf/2023/10/Qmwq)" ],
