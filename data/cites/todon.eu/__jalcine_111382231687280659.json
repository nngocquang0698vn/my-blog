    "summary" : [ "https://www.pcgamer.com/valve-steam-deck-oled-announcement/ reports Valve making a OLED Steam Deck. I'm pretty happy with mine, the lowest model of the second batch. Frankly, it's not \"just\" a console to me, it's a whole separate computer that I have to maintain (but in a kinda fun way and with a journaled file system so rolling back is easy).\n\nFor more causal folk, this might be the model they've been waiting for. A brighter screen, more power and it's lighter? (https://jacky.wtf/2023/11/mOe5)" ],
