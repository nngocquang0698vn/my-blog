    "summary" : [ "I know that I'm probably end up leaving where I work in the next few years because of my own personal interests around digital sovereignty (and truly, a want to move to communal structures of governance) but the more I think about it, the obsession of mine towards using electricity and silicon to help people self-govern is very utopian. If we can't do it with sheets of paper, a touch-screen interface won't help. I might be burned by the state of digital things and might not have enough bandwidth to keep hoping for better things. But maybe. (https://jacky.wtf/2023/2/ci5g)" ],
