If the fork's not community-run, it's nothing more than a \"revenue measuring\" contest between two tech CEOs over adoption (because big adopters acquire a lot and accelerate adoption - look at the virus of VS Code despite the vacuum of desktop alternatives people don't have to mention in their dotfiles). The Linux Foundation has (more or less) transformed into the perfect example of Commercial Open Source (open for you, plenty of funds for me but not non-corporate maintainers hahaha sike) extension of Microsoft (personal viewpoint) so even them taking in Terraform will be icky.\n\n\nBut then again, it's not like we got coops fabricating chips so it's the best we fucking got." ],
