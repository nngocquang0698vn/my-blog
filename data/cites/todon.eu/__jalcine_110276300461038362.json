    "summary" : [ "I can't really parse people defending BlueSky solely because Jack Dorsey is there.\n\nNor can I defend \"it being better\" because it explicitly has features that anti-abuse advocates have been saying for years has persistently used as vectors to run attacks against them.\n\nThere's people here that do claim publicly to care about people, especially Black people, that have run there, praised it contrary to the above and are prime examples of the false nature of ally ship. Once it's convenient or enough people of their class are ready to jump, they flee frantically.\n\nIn a way, good riddance. But also, I'm keeping receipts. I refuse to let people continue to enable abuse and harm for their protection of their social capital." ],
