Not because humans wanted them, but because of the LinkFetchWorker, which kicks off 1-60 seconds after Mastodon indexes a post (and possibly before it's ever seen by a human).\n\nEvery Mastodon instance fetches and stores their own local copy of my 750kb preview image.\n\n(I was inspired by to look by @jwz@mastodon.social's post:  https://mastodon.social/@jwz/109411593248255294.)" ],
