    "summary" : [ "As mentioned in the above toot yesterday, the UK government are going to be scaring the pants off half the country at 3pm today with an emergency alert test.\n\nIf you have a hidden phone you don't want someone finding out about, turn off emergency alerts in that phone's settings or turn the phone off. Otherwise it's very likely to make a loud noise once the test commences.\n\nEdit: Going through the replies suggests it's best to turn the SETTING off and NOT just the phone." ],
