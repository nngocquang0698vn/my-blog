    "summary" : [ "I've been trying to invest more and more of my free time interacting with founders. I genuinely feel we've been through a lot with Sentry and I can provide some useful value to others. More so, I believe most people in this industry, most successful people, do others a disservice but not having honest conversations about the hardships and endurance it takes to succeed. As part of that I thought it'd be interesting, or at least therapeutic, to talk about some of the history in written form. I previously wrote about Sentry's Seed Funding, but I want to go deeper on some other topics this time around. I'm not entirely sure what future topics I'll cover, but hopefully you'll find some value in it." ],
