Now, if you ask it to convert a value to a time, and it cannot parse it with one of the known format strings, Hugo bails and the entire build fails.

I'll then: Use a tool like grep to search my saved reply context data for the problematic time string (in this case \"2019-10-02 19:53-0700\").

With the \"fix\" in place, I'll rebuild the site.\nEither it builds successfully (hooray!) or I find the next time parsing failure and repeat.\nI seriously dislike this. A Future Fix\nWhat I actually need to do here is update my build system to sanitize the value of published if it exists.\nLike Hugo's list, I'll need to decide what date string formats I want to support, have the build system try them all on that published value, and store a sanitized version for Hugo.\nOkay!
