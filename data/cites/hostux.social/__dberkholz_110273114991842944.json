    "summary" : [ "I am really not a fan of all the managers & leaders posting \"Oh, it was so hard today because I had to lay people off.\"\n\n\nIt's 100x harder for the people who got laid off. Yeah you made some decisions and had some conversations. But you aren't the one who suddenly lost their job, who may not be able to make their mortgage or provide for themselves and their family, who is wondering if their career and experience is valid.\n\nStop with the \"woe is me\" as a leader. It's a bad look." ],
