Now.\n\nThat doesn't include Fido / Yubikeys but does include Auth tokens.\n\nDo it now.\n\nAs much a pain as it is to reset Echo and all smart devices, trust me, please do it.\n\nI can't tell you more yet, but I am being ethical and you need to actually realise I have a clue.\n\nIt's been a scary day" ],
