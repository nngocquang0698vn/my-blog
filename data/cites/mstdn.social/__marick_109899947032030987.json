Bazillions of people who also have jobs keep their wacko opinions to themselves, because, well, they are aware it would hurt them in the pocketbook. \n\nIt alarms me that the Andreesen class thinks that implausible claims that AI would share his prejudices won’t cause investors to shy away from him. He must assume tribal affinity pushes aside profit motive. Huh. Who woulda thunk it?" ],
