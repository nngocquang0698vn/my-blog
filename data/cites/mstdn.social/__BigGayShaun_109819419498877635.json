    "summary" : [ "Hi. Can I have a word?\n\nWhen you use a #Hashtag could you capitalise each word please? That way, people using screen readers will hear each individual word, which means they'll get more useful context as a result.\n\nWhen you don't capitalise hashtags the words string together and make no sense.\n\nFor example #ThisIsHow would read as \"This Is How\" while #thisishow would sound something like \"thissy show\". A small change for you but a game changer for many people.\n\nBe nice; get good karma. Thanks." ],
