    "summary" : [ "TL;DR: I'm going to leave Meta's social networking platforms (Facebook, Instagram) on June 16th, 2023. This website, byJP.me, will always show good ways to reach me and find out what I'm up to â€” please say hello if we haven't chatted in a while!\nI'm pretty fed up of Facebook and Instagram. I barely use them, but when I do I binge, and end up feeling terrible afterwards. I'm familiar with how sites like these use data analytics to group humans into buckets according to the best ways to maximise dopamine release, and the percent of our day we spent on their sites/apps, and it makes me itch." ],
