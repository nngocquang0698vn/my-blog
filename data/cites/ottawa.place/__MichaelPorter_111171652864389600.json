    "summary" : [ "Okay, #ADHD folks - what symptom suddenly makes sense, now that you understand ADHD better? \n\nI'm not talking about general stuff, like difficulty concentrating, I'm talking about specific phenomena, like having trouble following a conversation at a party. \n\nI always thought I had this problem because my ears are about a foot higher than the people speaking, but now I'm starting to think that the real difficulty is that my brain has trouble turning the volume down on all the other talking in the room.\n\n(I will occasionally repost this, along with whatever new symptom I've thought up... Apologies for the repetition) \n\n#ItAllMakesSenseNow" ],
