    "summary" : [ "@james@strangeobject.space THIS is why I resent any type of \"productivity measurement\".\n\nIf I as the person responsible for their (professional and sometimes very rarely personal) situation don't know how and what they feel and are working on, I should quit my job.\n\nI sometimes hear \"but we need abstract measurements to hand up to executive management\". No, you don't. Have a talk with them and tell them about the people you are working with. If they don't like this, this is not a good place to be.\n\nAnd regarding 'productivity': some people have a constant outfit of achievements or in software development tickets. That's productivity.\n\nBut some people 'produce' less individual results, but removing them from the team would lower everyone's productivity. That's generativity. I don't know many colleagues taking this into account or even noticing it exists." ],
