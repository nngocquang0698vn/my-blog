I worked in the advertising technology and security industry for five years and the one core piece of advice I have is:\n\nHoly fuck never give an advertiser your data. You cannot believe how bad it is. Don't. I run three layers of ad block protection and I'd run more if it was feasible. If you want to support creators give them money." ],
