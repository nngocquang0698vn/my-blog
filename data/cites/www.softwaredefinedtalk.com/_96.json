    "summary" : [ "The cat-nip of Mary Meeker's Internet Trends report is out this week so we discuss the highlights which leads to a sudden discussion of what an Amazon private cloud product would look like. Then, with a raft of new container related news we sort out what CoreOS is doing with their Tectonic managed service, what Heptio is (the Mirantis of  Kubernetes?), and then a deep dive into the newly announced Istio which seems to be looking to create a yaml-based(!) standard for microservices configuration and policy and, then, the actual code for managing it all. Also, an extensive analysis of a hot-dog display, which is either basting itself or putting on some condiment-hair." ],
