    "summary" : [ "Due to Coté feeling weird (and being diagnosed with the flu), this week you get a curated selection of our new podcast, Software Defined Interviews. There are two artisanal selected clips. First, a discussion with Jon Collins about GDPR - will it actually work, or just be another regulation eye-roller? Then, there’s a rapid fire questions session with Nancy Gohring of 451 Research - we talk about Cisco’s AppDynamics acquisition, ServiceNow, and Honeycomb. Both of these are just a tiny bit of the full interviews, which you should totally check out by subscribing to Software Defined Interviews: [http://www.softwaredefinedinterviews.com/](http://www.softwaredefinedinterviews.com/)" ],
