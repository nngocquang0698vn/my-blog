    "summary" : [ "In hindu mythology, there is casual violence committed on \"demons\" who are supposed to be terrible people. Today is a day that celebrates the death of one of those for the South Indian hindus. Given how hindus treat Indigenous people today, it is not lost on me that it is very likely that those \"demons\" were likely innocent folks upon whom we inflicted violence 2000 years ago and decided to cement that horror in a mythology conveniently claiming these folks deserved it. \n\nThis is why I do not celebrate Diwali. The closer you peer into hinduism, the more oppressive it becomes." ],
