I want to be part of a \"mature\" team, a \"powerful\" team with a large and well-managed \"throughput\", a \"structured\" team that knows how to use processes to quickly and accurately handle the Same Stuff Happens Every Week so that when someone else comes screaming in with their ass on fire babbling about something someone else broke and We Need To Document This Thing NOW NOW NOW, one or two of us can calmly turn from our current tasks, neatly and quickly handle La Emergencia, and calm the panicked person's heartrate without raising our own.\n\nI'm old. Fuck \"ambition\". I just want a good paycheck and no dumbass \"this REALLY could have been avoided\" hasslepanic." ],
