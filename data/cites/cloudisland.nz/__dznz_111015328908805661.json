    "summary" : [ "PSA: until you've experienced burnout, you are likely to underestimate how long it takes to recover. It's not a couple of months, it's 6-18 months for partial recovery, and maybe 3 years for full recovery (all depending on how bad it gets). The company burning you out will almost never support your recovery, mostly they'll drop you when you stop being productive.\n\nNobody in business cares about your health but you, so be your own advocate, or suffer the consequences." ],
