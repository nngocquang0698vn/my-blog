In 2016 a famous YouTuber jokingly offered to support Mastodon's Patreon forever if I change the button to say \"Toot\" instead. Needless to say, this was a really early, and not very informed decision. The first glimpse of attention and financial support. As a non-native speaker I had no idea there was another meeting.",
