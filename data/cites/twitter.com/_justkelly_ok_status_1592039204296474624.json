      "alt" : "grown ass men are out here not eating fruit or vegetables or washing their face and having a list of things women must do to be attractive to them and thus gain their respect like grow the fuck up and eat a carrot literally no woman needs you\n\n\"No woman needs you\" said the future cat lady lol\nNewsflash. No man needs a bitch telling him to eat rabbit food and nagging him constantly.\nI cannot wait to see feminism burn itself out.\n\nI don't get why 'cat lady' is an insult to women.\nMy dude, you got this backward; welcome to the modern era, we have careers, money, we buy our own houses and cars, and we have easy access to a selection of vibrators our ancestresses could only dream of. Companionship is great and everything, but as many of us discovered, it comes in many forms.\nIf a woman has a cat but you don't see a guy, that's usually because she did the math and overall, men scored lower than a furry animal that shits in a box and a Hitachi.",
