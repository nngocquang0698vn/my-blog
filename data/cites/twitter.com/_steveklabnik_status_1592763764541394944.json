Singular 3rd person form of to \"be\" is \"is\". Do you say \"they is\"? No you don't, ergo it cannot be a singular form.\n\nThere is nothing \"inclusive\" about wrong English. I've heard \"they\" used incorrectly about a million times now. It will never sound correct to me no matter how often I hear it.",
