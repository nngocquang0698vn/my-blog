      "alt" : "Wikipedia entry: The Feast of the Ass (Latin: Festum Asinorum, asinaria festa; French: Fête de l'âne) is a medieval, Christian feast observed on 14 January, celebrating the Flight into Egypt. It was originally celebrated primarily in France, as a by-product of the Feast of Fools celebrating the donkey-related stories in the Bible, in particular the donkey bearing the Holy Family into Egypt after Jesus's birth.[1]",
