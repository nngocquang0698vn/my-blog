      "alt" : "A redesign of the cover of Leviathan Wakes in the style of psychedelic retro scifi. In the foreground is Julie Mao, seen from the shoulders up, covered in the protomolecule in shades of blue and purple. Behind her on the right is detective Miller in shades of yellow and orange, his back to the viewer, face in profile, tipping his hat, planets and moons forming a circle around his head. On Julie's left is the Rocinante in shades of pink and red, stylized fire spilling out beneath it. The top of the cover says \"Leviathan wakes, James S. A. Corey\" and on the bottom there is a small, italized quote that says \"Welcome to the future.\" The whole illustration has a yellowed, textured look of an old book. ",
