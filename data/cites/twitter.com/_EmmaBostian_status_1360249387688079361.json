We picked out names, researched strollers, and told our closest friends and family. We were thrilled.\n\nBut as I sit here, writing this post at ten weeks pregnant, I am having a miscarriage.\n\nAfter two hospital visits and a very painful blood draw, the doctors simply said ‚Äúthis is very common and there‚Äôs nothing we can do.‚Äù And while they‚Äôre right, that doesn‚Äôt make it any less painful.\n\nI have never been in this much physical pain in my entire life. It‚Äôs been several days of extensive bleeding and the only thing that helps is crying/screaming. Pain medication doesn‚Äôt help. I‚Äôve almost passed out from the immense pain. I am not okay. I won‚Äôt be okay for a while. But I‚Äôll get there, slowly."
