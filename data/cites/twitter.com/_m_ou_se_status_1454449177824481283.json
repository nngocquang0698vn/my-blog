The girl to the right of me is wearing black nail polish and a ring, and has a glass with some red drink. The girl opposite of me is holding a drink in her other hand (also with black nail polish) and has her phone in front of her on the table with a rainbow flag sticker on it. The girl next to her is the only one not wearing nail polish. It's all very cute.",
