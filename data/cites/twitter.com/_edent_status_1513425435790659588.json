We believed the best path forward was having Elon as a fiduciary of Twitter where he, like all board members, must act in the best interests of our company and our shareholders. The board offered him a seat (contingent on a background check and formal acceptance). The effective date was 4/9, but the same day Elon shared that he will no longer be joining. I believe this is for the best. We will always value input from shareholders and remain open to his. Our goals and priorities are unchanged. Let's tune out the noise and stay focused on what weâ€™re building.",
