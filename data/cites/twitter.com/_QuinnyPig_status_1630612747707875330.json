      "alt" : "For service or platform to be considered serverless, it should provide the\nfollowing capabilities:\n• No server management – You don’t have to provision or maintain\nany servers. There is no software or runtime to install, maintain, or\nadminister.\n• Flexible scaling – You can scale your application automatically or by\nadjusting its capacity through toggling the units of consumption (for\nexample, throughput, memory) rather than units of individual servers.\n• High availability – Serverless applications have built-in availability\nand fault tolerance. You don't need to architect for these capabilities\nbecause the services running the application provide them by default.\n• No idle capacity – You don't have to pay for idle capacity. There is no\nneed to pre-provision or over-provision capacity for things like compute\nand storage. There is no charge when your code isn’t running",
