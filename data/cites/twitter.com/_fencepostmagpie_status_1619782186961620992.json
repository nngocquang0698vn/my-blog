      "alt" : "a political cartoon. a large television screen with a picture of a woman says \"I'll feminize you if you stop being edgy online\". The television is labeled \"BIG SISTER\", and is on a platform labeled \"1984!!\". looking at the screen pleadingly, a man labeled \"impressionable young 'incels'\" is saying \"Promise?\". \nGazing on at the scene is a hanging jail cell, \"Woke Jail\", holding the familiar faces of Jordan B Peterson (crying), Andrew Tate, and Ben Shapiro. The jail cell has the label \"MASC ROLE MODELS\". Peterson cries \"The dragon of chaos!\" while Tate states in silence and Shapiro silently prays \"me next me next me next\".\nBelow the jail cell, the beautiful and kind artist says \"I lost my job to automation!\"\n\nSurrounding context: An AI chatbot designed to role-play feminizing the user recently trended, as the AI takes a hard stance on the user being racist or otherwise edgy.",
