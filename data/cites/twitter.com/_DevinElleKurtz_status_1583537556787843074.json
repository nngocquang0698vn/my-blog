Up ahead, in lit by sunlight breaking through a foggy sky, a long white dragon splashes out of the lake and floats into the clouds. Ahead, the road bends around the mountain, winding around the lake and presumably into the distance beyond. The smallest child jumps into the air waving her arms at the dragon",
