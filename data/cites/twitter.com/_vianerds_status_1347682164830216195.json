Inside of it, they place a small baby shaped figure that represents baby Jesus. This year, in Mexico, people were selling the cake with figures of Baby Yoda instead of the baby Jesus. So, conservative groups are extremely upset about it, and are calling it a direct attack to family values and religion. So now, Baby Yoda is considered a LGBT icon for making furious those conservative, homophobic people."
