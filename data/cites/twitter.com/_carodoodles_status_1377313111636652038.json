They’re signing “Trans?” The word balloon is light pink. Right is a masculine brown person with a hearing aid, a vest and a nail polish. They’re signing “Beautiful.” The handshake for Trans and Beautiful are same, but Trans is signed over one’s heart (aka, beautiful in heart), while Beautiful is signed in circular movement in front of face."
