It turned them into little, unrecoverable bricks.\nIt was not awesome seeing a bunch of servers go dark in just about the order we had originally powered them on. Not a fun day at all.\n\nYou are never going to guess how long the HN SSDs were in the servers... never ever... OK... I'll tell you: 4.5years. I am not even kidding.\n\nLet me narrow my guess: They hit 4 years, 206 days and 16 hours . . . or 40,000 hours.\nAnd that they were sold by HP or Dell, and manufactured by SanDisk.\n\nDo I win a prize?\n\n(None of us win prizes on this one).\n\nThese were made by SanDisk (SanDisk Optimus Lightning II) and the number of hours is between 39,984 and 40,032...",
