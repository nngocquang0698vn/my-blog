    "summary" : [ "The first rule of salary negotiation is the new hire budget is bigger than the promotion budget. It is always easier to negotiate a higher starting salary or hiring bonus than getting a raise or promotion after you’ve gotten the job.\n\nI’ve been stunned at how low the bar is for hiring managers to OK a higher offer for a new hire versus fighting for a raise for one of their team members. Never believe a recruiter who says you can get a bump after you start and do well unless it’s in writing." ],
