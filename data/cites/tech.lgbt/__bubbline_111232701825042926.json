You really don't want your blocking decisions to be based on people who add things to a list on a whim with no accountability and oversight.\n\nBut even outside of block lists... god when are progressive communities going to get over this obsession with performative punishment and branding people as bad?\n\nI've never seen this instance allow bad people to stay, moderators always take care of things, and they're usually pretty responsive. It's beyond absurd to block tech.lgbt" ],
