    "summary" : [ "I always struggle when groups fundraise with urgency. Like Wikipedia, we need your money now!!!!\n\nAnd all I can think is, Jimmy I recognise you’re a not for profit but you do this every year, with the same messages about how you simply cannot continue your work if you don’t get money. And I get distracted because all I think of is the dril budgeting tweet.\n\nIf I could see the numbers in the same line as your urgency message, I’d understand more and  are thus more likely to donate. “We have X money left which our accountants say we will no longer be able to pay our stuff after the following date”\n\nShouting “urgent!” Every time I open the page for the last two decades, with no numbers in the sentence, stops being urgent and is just something I gloss over against my better judgement" ],
