    "summary" : [ "I had a thing yesterday where a mutual made a joke that was likely supposed to be lewd. Someone replied with a follow up joke. I had another joke to that reply and I was typing it up and then I was like \n\n“wait, just because this person is telling a sexual joke does not actually mean they want one in response. Being mutuals does not mean I have carte blanche. Don’t be a weirdo”\n\nThought it might be useful to read. Just because someone does something doesn’t mean you can also do it. And being mutuals doesn’t mean there aren’t boundaries. \n\nAnd at the end of the day, is the joke you’re thinking of saying even that funny? Probably not." ],
