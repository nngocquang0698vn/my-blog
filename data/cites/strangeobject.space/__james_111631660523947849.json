Upon discovering that you just sort of have to do the thing, you close all the tabs. You ignore your previous attempts to find an answer and do the same post a week later in the hopes that someone has come up with the perfectly suited to you way to do one task. You feel shame and embarrassment and anger and often nothing at all, whilst neurotypical people tell you that it’s easy to do one task you just have to want to do it. You want to do a lot of things but even the things that give you joy are insurmountable” disorder\n\n:)" ],
