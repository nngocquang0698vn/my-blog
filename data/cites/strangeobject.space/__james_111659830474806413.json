    "summary" : [ "This is in no way a brag, but in reference to my earlier thread on take Covid seriously: I just paid 200 quid to move my trip to Berlin (that’s supposed to start tomorrow) back five days in the hope that Esther will not be testing negative after her Covid then rebound Covid.\n\nAnd if she is still, then I am unable to get a refund.\n\nWe haven’t seen each other since October, we’ve both spent the holidays alone, and live alone. My mental health is affected and surely hers is too. But going there whilst she’s sick just gets me sick and then people on the plane sick. \n\nThis is not a post about how good I am, this a post to say hey yeah I get it it’s fucking frustrating that this debilitating virus is still fucking our lives up four years later. But by taking care, I can stop myself and others from getting sick.\n\nObviously I can afford it, but I’m afraid that even if you can’t afford to reschedule, going would cost you in other ways." ],
