    "summary" : [ "Okay assessment done\n\nI am fucking EXHAUSTED!!!!\n\nHe says I get no autism points for my emotive facial expressions and gesticulation (I’m the human emoji after all) but whilst not giving me a definitive diagnosis and I have to wait a week he says there are several areas that speak to an ADS diagnosis\n\nProbably the fact I spent the entire two and a half hours staring outside the window whilst waxing lyrical about “I don’t know” or when asked to define specific emotions or “happiness is a lack of sadness I guess?” and “no I find most people irritating” and “I don’t really feel anything at all” when asked to talk about family stuff\n\nAnd I’m going to send him my report from my private assessor :) \n\nSo fingers crossed I get declared autism\n\nStarted to shut down at the end so glad that’s over" ],
