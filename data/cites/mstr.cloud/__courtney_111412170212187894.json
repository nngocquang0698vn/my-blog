Deep down, though, they're troubled, confused, envious - and above all, sick to death of living a lie.\n\nIt's me! I was that someone.\n\nAfter 30 years of pretending to be a boy, I put a stop to that. You can see here what happened next: I became the confident, friendly and happy woman that I was supposed to be all along!\n\nThis #TransgenderAwarenessWeek, remember that we're all just trying to make the most of the life we have. Someone else you know may be wrestling with these same thoughts, and they deserve your kindness and empathy like everyone else.\n\n#Trans #TimelineTuesday" ],
