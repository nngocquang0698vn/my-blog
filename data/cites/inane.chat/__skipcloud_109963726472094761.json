    "summary" : [ "Since my #ADHD diagnosis I’ve been looking at my life to see what things I do can be ascribed to the condition.\n\nOne thing I suck at is texting and small talk. If your text asks me an open ended question like “hey, how are you?” then I put off responding to it for weeks. It’s one of the reasons I have so few friends now.\n\nI found threads on Reddit from other ADHDers that have problems with texting too which made me feel better!" ],
