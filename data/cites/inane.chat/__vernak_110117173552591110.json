You can find it at https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-workspace-zoom-def/nflkcdlimipkgbacnfnhfecjgmojhklo.\n\nI also wrong about it on my blog (https://words.byvernacchia.com/blog/2023/03/introducing-google-workspace-zoom-default/).\n\nHope this helps you! It was really cool/easy to build with @plasmohq" ],
