    "summary" : [ "For everyone who feels insecure about your relationships with others - partners, friends, etc. - do they actually like me? Am I tricking them or deceiving them or what if I'm secretly a bad person?:\n\nRemember - the other people in the relationship with you are whole-ass people with their own thoughts, feelings, needs, desires, etc. These actual whole-ass people have their own agency, and have decided to spend their time on this earth with you.\n\nIf you've not been intentionally misleading them or hiding things or tricking them into being with you, then it probably means they actually like you for who you are. You're probably not as good at hiding who you are as you think, which means they know the parts of you that suck, and they like you despite or even BECAUSE of the parts of you that suck.\n\nIt's okay to simply trust those who love you to have chosen to love you because you're you." ],
