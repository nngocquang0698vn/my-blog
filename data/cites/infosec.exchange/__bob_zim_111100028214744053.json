    "summary" : [ "@ferricoxide@evil.social @ian@hachyderm.io @kentindell@mastodon.social This etymology isn’t universally agreed upon, but it is one of the oldest proposed (dating to the late 1700s). “Pumpern” was supposedly new high German slang for the act of farting. Definitely verb form, likely future tense. Something like “you will fart like the devil” if the etymology is to be believed.\n\nNew high German is approximately modern German, and pumpern is not slang for farting in any modern-German-speaking area I’m familiar with. Then again, German has a lot of unusual euphemisms and reverse-euphemisms. Could be one I’ve never encountered." ],
