    "summary" : [ "I’m the kind of person who withdraws when things don’t feel great in my world. Maybe it’s trauma, maybe it’s a core part of how my introversion manifests, maybe it’s an issue with object impermanence (out of sight, out of mind). 🤷🏻‍♀️\n\nIn any case, it means the world to me when my truest friends check in on me and send kind messages, memes, or emojis just to let me know they’re thinking about me. Maintaining relationships can be difficult and I’m not always great at it, but I have so much love for the people who stick around even when it feels like I’m not present.\n\nI promise I’m doing my best to be a great friend and I appreciate all the people willing to carry the load when I’m not doing a great job. I retreat to my safe (alone) space a lot, but I really appreciate the people in my life who don’t let me get stuck there. \n\nThis is all just to say, don’t give up on your friends who go radio silent sometimes. I bet they miss you as much as you miss them but they’re just not great at expressing it. It’s super hard when your coping mechanism is isolation but your love languages are words of affirmation and physical touch. Ask me how I know. 😉" ],
