Having worked with people from all over Europe, the work culture is the same. \n\n“My time is MY time”. Just last week I asked a junior colleague to do something (not knowing the time) at half 4 on Friday. Their reply was leaning back on their chair and poking their head around the desk divider and saying “have you seen the time? You can absolutely get to fuck with that”.\n\nCompletely the correct response." ],
