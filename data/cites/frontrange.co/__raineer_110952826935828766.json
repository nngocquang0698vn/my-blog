    "summary" : [ "Iâ€™m just so impressed at the current state of #linux desktop #gaming , and how much is owed to #steamdeck and the progress it forced on #proton\n\nIâ€™m old now, so I donâ€™t get to play many hours anymore, but Iâ€™m just amazed how easy it is now. \n\nAnything I want to play is not only supported, but plays exactly as good (or better) than it does on windows. \n\nZero issues with playing in HiDPI. Everything plays in 5K with no problems, even stuff released in the last two weeks. \n\nSteam UI still needs a workaround for HiDPI, but itâ€™s straightforward enough to add a parameter at launch. Once youâ€™re in a game, thereâ€™s no difference. \n\nLove it." ],
