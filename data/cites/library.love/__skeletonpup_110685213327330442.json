It was created by Ann Magill, a disabled writer.\n\nThe entire thing will not fit into the thumbnail but if you open the image, it will tell you what each color and flag feature stands for. It is also in the alt text if you are unable to open it.\n\n#disabled #accessibility #cerebralpalsy #adhd #autism #OCD #PTSD #bipolar #depression #invisibleillness (& more!)" ],
