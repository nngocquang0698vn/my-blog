The person you *thought* you knew was only a fa√ßade constructed for protection . You only saw the armor they put on everyday, not them. Now that they've learned their differences aren't \"their fault\" or because \"they are broken\" or whatever, they can let their guard down. For maybe the first time in their life, they aren't forcing themselves to be who they aren't.\n\n3/4" ],
