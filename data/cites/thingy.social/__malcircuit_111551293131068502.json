    "summary" : [ "I'm anti-war because the more I learn about history, the more it's clear that wars have a legacy that extends for decades or centuries beyond when they officially end.\n\nAnd I don't mean only the lives lost.\n\nThe propaganda drives people insane and clouds their vision for decades. All of the things people \"had\" to do to \"win\" end up bringing about unintended and unanticipated consequences that never really disappear from society. \n\nThe madness incites more madness." ],
