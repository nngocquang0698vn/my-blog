    "summary" : [ "The truth is exactly the opposite. Anyone that's \"different\" in our culture learns very quickly to hide their differences. The world punishes anyone who's different — usually not explicitly, but by enforcing expectations that cannot be met. People start doing what's known as \"masking\" — they hold back their true selves and maintain an appearance of normalcy by any means. Usually masking is driven by guilt, shame, and anxiety, and it often leads to burnout or worse. It takes a toll on people.\n2/4" ],
