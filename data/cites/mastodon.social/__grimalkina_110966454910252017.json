We're not interested in tallying who's using what brands for some trends report. We're interested in how developers are DOING. This is also a pilot test of new measures, so the more folks take it, the more we learn how to design deep research on this! Please share widely. #softwaredevelopment \n\nhttp://bit.ly/3OLmIul" ],
