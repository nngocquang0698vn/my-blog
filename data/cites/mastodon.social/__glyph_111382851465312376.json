    "summary" : [ "Until there is a definitive adjudication of the copyright status of LLM training data, it is *deeply irresponsible* to use Github Copilot for open source. I will refuse contributions created with it on any project I'm involved with, as well as permanently ban any user caught sneaking in Copilot-generated code in defiance of this rule. I would strongly encourage all maintainers to take this stand as well. License headaches are already bad enough without secret poison pills being injected." ],
