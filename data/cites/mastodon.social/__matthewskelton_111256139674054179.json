But there are plenty of smart, highly capable women in Tech that would significantly enhance your event by speaking there. \n\nBuild your network. Listen to women. Then get a 50:50 women:men organizing team. 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Then listen some more. \n\nMaybe then women will say \"yes\" to your event. \n\n#rant" ],
