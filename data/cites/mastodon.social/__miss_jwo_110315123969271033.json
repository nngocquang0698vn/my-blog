When it labels the unborn child the same sex as the baby I’m having; it flows fine; but when they name it the opposite I feel like I’m reading the wrong book. \n\nIn a language where we have a non-gender option of words; it’s interesting to see in a book how comfortable they are at switching the unborn child’s gender." ],
