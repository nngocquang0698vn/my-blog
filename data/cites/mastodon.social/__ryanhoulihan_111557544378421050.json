    "summary" : [ "Despite not seeking it out, I wake up to hate speech, I stumble upon hate speech all day, I go to bed after looking at hate speech that I’m too exhausted to process. Then I have a nightmare. Every day. Over and over.\n\nWhen I tell people this, their advice is that I should exclude myself from things and spaces and pretend it’s not happening. I should “just” get a different job.\n\nThis is not good advice and only further isolates me from even the people who aren’t spewing outright hatred about us." ],
