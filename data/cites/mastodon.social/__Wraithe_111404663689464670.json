If you write out any word and\nthen look at it for too long-tomato, paucity,\npreponderance, disintegrate-the spelling\nwill start to look funny…So\nwhat if your gender changes tomorrow and\nthen changes again twelve years from now?…Who you are changes. Humans are messy. Gender is even messier”" ],
