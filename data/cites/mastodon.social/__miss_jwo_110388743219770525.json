Some of them are ones I would personally back, some are ones I wouldnâ€™t back.  \n\nBut my favourite thing to do in meetings is suggest at least one outrageous idea. The more wild the better. Why? Because then all other ideas look more reasonable and allows people to dismiss something and make a decision." ],
