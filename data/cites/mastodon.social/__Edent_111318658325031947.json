Your browser literally doesn't tell the server where it clicked from.\n\nNow, some writers might be putting different tracking on their Twitter and Mastdon links.\n\nBut, by design, Mastodon doesn't show up in servers referral logs.\nWhether that's a good thing or not is left as an exercise for the reader." ],
