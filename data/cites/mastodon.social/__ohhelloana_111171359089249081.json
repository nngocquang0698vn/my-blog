Not only did I find my current job through chatting with people there, but the talks I saw and the people I met throughout the years were the inspiration and acceptance I desperately needed to find. \n\nBecause of that, I'm over the moon to speak at @ffconf@social.ffconf.org and I hope I can contribute to people feeling as happy at the end of the day as I felt all these previous years as an attendee. \n\nSee you there? ðŸ’– \n\nhttps://2023.ffconf.org/" ],
