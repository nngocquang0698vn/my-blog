Nor is gender equity in pay an argument when ALL execs are overpaid and where pay equity is worst is at the entry level and among the precariat.\n\nSeriously, stop trying to justify a $7 million salary.  Executive compensation is a PROBLEM, and while it's nothing specific to Mozilla, you can say this without pretending it's healthy.\n\n2/2" ],
