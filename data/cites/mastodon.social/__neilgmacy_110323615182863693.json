    "summary" : [ "If you’ve ever seen Quantum of Solace, you’ll see an example of what happens when you continue with a production during a writers’ strike. Awful movie, and it was in between Casino Royale and Skyfall which were great.\n\nI’ll be so upset if Disney ruin season 2 of Andor, given that will be the end of the whole thing. There won’t be a season 3, season 2 goes right up to the Rogue One movie https://gizmodo.com/andor-season-2-production-writers-strike-1850411776" ],
