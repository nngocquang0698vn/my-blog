Sound comes out of my monitor.\n\nIt is *impossible* to control the volume of the Mac once it is connected. Laptop volume buttons just show the ðŸš« symbol when pressed.\n\nIt's a work Mac, so I can't install any software on it to change this behaviour. But, frankly, why should I have to? Every other laptop works fine with an external speaker. \n\nWhy are Macs so crap?" ],
