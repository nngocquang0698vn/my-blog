On every count it is objectively worse than previous iterations.\n\nPage load time is poor, interactivity is gated seemingly on very large JS loads. Initial page layout is broken on mobile and randomly resizes the width of the viewport after loading. The number of micro-annoyances seem to be adding up daily.\n\nThis is like an object lesson in what not to do to your successful webapp." ],
