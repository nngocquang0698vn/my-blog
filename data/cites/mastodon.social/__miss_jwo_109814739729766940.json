I became a EM 4 years ago, and I’m now expecting a brat (hope for the best, expect the worse) to join me; so please adjust expectations of my commitment and communications accordingly. \n\nDo let me know if you need any remote support for any community groups or events; because I do miss it. ( but be warned I’ve been out of the game for a little while. ) \n\nCheers!" ],
