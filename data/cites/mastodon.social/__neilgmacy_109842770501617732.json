Cleaned up the landing page a little, added a /now page like all the cool kids have.\n\nI’m very open to constructive criticism, I’m still miles away from being satisfied with it. Especially style-wise, I have a lot to fix in the CSS, particularly just moving away from the Publish basic template.\n\nFeels good to have done all this on an iPhone though. Working Copy and WorldWideWeb are really useful apps." ],
