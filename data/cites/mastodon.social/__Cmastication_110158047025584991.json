Can we measure that? \n\nThe best engineers I’ve worked with are the ones who can simplify problems and guide the team through the simplified vision. These engineers didn’t look 10x productive by measures of line count, to git commits or hours in the office. But their team got a lot done and, more importantly, didn’t waste time on dumb shit and over engineering. Most orgs suck at measuring those folks." ],
