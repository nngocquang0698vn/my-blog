One of them was Alanis Morissette because it was always on. \n\nAnyway... I was a fool. It's so embarrassing to admit that I am only now appreciating her songs. \n\nOn the other hand, if I had known about \"You Oughta Know\" many years ago when I had a heartbreak, I probably would have embarrassed myself on social media at the time. ðŸ˜‚" ],
