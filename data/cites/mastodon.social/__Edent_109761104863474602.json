It serves all the images & fonts in their billing emails.\n\nI defensively registered it to prevent an attacker from injecting malicious content into the emails I receive.\n\nThen I emailed their security.txt contact to inform them and offering to transfer it back (for free, obviously).\n\nWas that the right thing to do? Should I have waited for a response from them before securing the bucket?" ],
