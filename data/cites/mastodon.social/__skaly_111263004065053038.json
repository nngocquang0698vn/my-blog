I'm Skaly, an awkward neurodivergent queer who makes a lot of projects and does their best to be as ambitious as possible and to work with the different abilities and disabilities and not against them. I make a living from art, and it's super fluid and challenging but I do what I love, music, handmade jewelry, poetry and film. I'm 23 and UK based but looking to move to the US next year. Art stuff: https://linktr.ee/skalymusic" ],
