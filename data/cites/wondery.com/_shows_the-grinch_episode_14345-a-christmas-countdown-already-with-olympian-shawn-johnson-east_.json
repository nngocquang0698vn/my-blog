    "summary" : [ "From the top of Mt. Crumpit, it’s the very first episode of ’Tis The Grinch Holiday Talk Show! The OG green grump (voiced by SNL’s James Austin Johnson) has been ordered to host his very own talk show as a punishment for that little misunderstanding where he tried to “steal” Christmas. On this episode, he unveils his (slightly questionable) advent calendar, plays a game of “Name That Sound,” and chats from the desk with special guest Olympic gymnast Shawn Johnson East! She says Santa would never cut it on the balance beam. Your move, Santa!" ],
