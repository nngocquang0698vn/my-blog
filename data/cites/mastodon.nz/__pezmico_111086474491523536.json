It is not. \n\nSay \"post lockdowns\", \"After the initial response\", \"since public health measures expired\", \"during the global emergency phase\", \"while schools were closed\". \n\nUse accurate terms for what you mean, don't erase this gigantic ongoing issue. \n\nDon't gaslight more. \n\nRemember that language is powerful and #CovidIsNotOver" ],
