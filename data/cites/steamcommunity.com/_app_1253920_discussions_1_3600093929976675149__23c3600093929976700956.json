    "summary" : [ "So I just defeated the bosses in the the Sygian Study, and on that particular run I had a hiccupy audio bug going on that I had not witness. There was no game lag that I had perceived but the audio every few seconds felt like lag (if that makes sense). So I was going to restart my game after the run. I was playing on a steam deck. I got the item that gives you 30% more of your gold for an instant death, giving me over 10k gold." ],
