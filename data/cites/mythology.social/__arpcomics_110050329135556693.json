It’s\n\n“a growing world-wide network of meetups for everyone who wants to take back their web experience from #socialMedia silos, and own their online identities & content, or just want support with #blogging!”\n\nI’ve been anti-digital sharecropping for awhile and with my new #blog, this is right up my alley.\n\nI’d love to try to do a #meetup locally in person but this might be a cool thing to do as a monthly #webchat here on #Mastodon/the #Fediverse.\n\nComment or boost if you’re interested in joining a regular webchat here.\n\nhttps://indieweb.org/Homebrew_Website_Club" ],
