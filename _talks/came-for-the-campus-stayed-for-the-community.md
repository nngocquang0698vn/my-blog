description:
  After falling in love with the gorgeous campus at the University of Nottingham, Jamie found he had to come to Nottingham. And when he discovered the vibrant, buzzing tech community, he found he had to stay. In this talk, Jamie will take you on his journey to coming to Nottingham, and the decisions that led to him staying. As part of that, Jamie will discuss how his decision to join Capital One's graduate scheme over a "regular role" elsewhere was a difficult one, and how he's found it since.
