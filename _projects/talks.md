I have a public repository with each of my talks available for others to be able to view, as well as being able to track changes to the talks over time.

I had previously stored the talks in separate repos, but as I was writing more, I wanted to bring them into a central place to make them easier to share.

The talks were originally written in LaTeX Beamer to generate modern looking LaTeX PDF presentations, but as mentioned in my [Reveal.js Starter project](/projects/revealjs-starter/), I recently migrated to using Reveal.js to build the slides, for a few reasons:

- LaTeX's syntax highlighting felt a little lacking compared to that of tooling like Reveal.js
- Being able to use [Gruvbox](), the color scheme I use on my own machines, for syntax highlighting was quite a cool, if not completely irrelevant, bonus
- Being able to embed terminal sessions into the slides via [asciinema's asciicasts](https://asciinema.org/) was a big draw
