`workshopr` is a (WIP) tool that simplifies the setup for an online environment required to get up and running for a workshop.

Its main use is for when the number of dependencies required in order to run a workshop is too great to get installed in time for the organisers, and is born out of a workaround I made at InspireWIT 2016.

It spins up a VPS, provisions it with required tooling, and a given number of pre-defined usernames and passwords, all with access to the files.
