Review apps may be easier if we move the Nginx configs in-tree first
- We can get Capistrano/Rake to perform our deploy, symlink and config
- Then we can add a Capistrano/Rake task for i.e. `review:start`, `review:update` and `review:end`?


- use `last-modified` attribute for each page
- fix `/tags/`
- fix running on Windows? or remove
- /projects/
	- [ ] `img`s point to wrong URL
	- [ ] no CSS (still using old theme)
	- [ ] Is this the way we want it to be done? Or like on the homepage?
- update `/projects/jvt.me`

- add `#`s before each header
- search
- highlight on `get_pr.py`
- don't switch to browser when browserify is complete
- make more sass-y
