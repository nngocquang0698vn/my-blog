In my second year group project, we created an application called Football Facsimile, which aimed to recreate the game of football as a fully independent computer simulation.

Each player in the seven-aside game was modelled as an independent agent in the simulation, and would act accordingly based on their position of other players. For instance, if a player deemed that the nearest opposing team member would be able to intercept a shot, they would then work out if they could pass to another team member.

As the game performs completely independently, it is quite interesting to watch the game play out.
