The Storytime project aims to provide a more immersive environment for reading to children, by providing context-sensitive lighting for a smart lightbulb that changes depending on the page's content; for instance, if there is a flame on the page, the light will flicker like a candle.

This is an idea that we are continuing to pursue, and as such source and details are not provided aside from that which can be found [on StoryTi.me](http://storyti.me).
