The design for my personal site is adapted using the Solid State theme by HTML5Up, because I'm a developer, not a designer, although I would have loved to have created my own design.

I adapted the site and integrated it into Jekyll, which powers the site. As my first full Jekyll project, I have used as many best Jekyll practices as possible, such as taking advantage of the `_data` directory, and using different layouts for the projects pages.
