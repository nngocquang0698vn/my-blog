In my second year group project, we created an application called Football Facsimile, which aimed to recreate the game of football as a fully independent computer simulation. Each player in the <span style="color:red">five-aside</span> game was modelled as an <span style="color:red">agent in the simulation</span>, and <span style="color:red">???</span>.
The project was created with Java using the <a href="http://lwjgl.org">Lightweight Java Game Library</a>.
