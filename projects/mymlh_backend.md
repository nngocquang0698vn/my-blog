While organising <a href="http://hacknotts.com">HackNotts</a>, I found that while <a href="https://my.mlh.io/">MyMLH</a> API was great for collecting the data from all attendees, it did not provide any ability for us to have ticket release features like releasing tickets in batches, or working out when to allocate tickets into the waitlist.

As such, I have organised a <a href="https://trello.com/b/D3CQGnpy/mymlh-backend">Trello board</a> with feature requests I will be aiming to complete for the system. I'm planning on developing this during hackathons and in my free time.
