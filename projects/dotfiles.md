- My dotfiles are all the configuration files I use with my Arch install, such as Vim and my Window Manager, BSPWM. These configs are shared on Github so I can easily clone them wherever I am, and also so others can see how I like things configured.
- I try to keep my dotfiles following good practices, both with Git, and with its code. As such, my commit messages explain the reasonings for the changes, in such a way that I'll be able to go back and work out why I added it. 
- I recently added the ability to bootstrap my system by simply cloning the repo and running `./bootstrap.sh`, which installs my dotfiles in the correct places and installs all associated dependencies needed.
