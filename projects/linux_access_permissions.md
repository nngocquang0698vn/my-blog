description: A project to provide permissions for Linux packages, which inform the user of potential privacy issues such as access to personal files.
---
For my final year dissertation, I am working on <em>'Mobile Style Applications for Linux'</em>, which aims to provide permissions for Linux packages, focussing on protection of privacy. 

The project will inform users when they are installing packages of the permissions a given application would require to function correctly, and allow the user to edit them. If a permission is denied, the Operating System will deny the application's request using standard error codes.
