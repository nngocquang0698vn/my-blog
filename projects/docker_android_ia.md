While working at Intel, I was part of an Android tablet project for a large UK retailer. As part of this, we worked on building versions of the Android Operating System with custom patches. The turnaround for the whole build process was around 40 minutes, which at times was <span style="color:red">unforgiving</span>. Therefore, I was tasked with setting up a server internally that would allow us to build Android much more quickly.

I used Docker to set up isolated environments which would contain all necessary dependencies for the version of Android needed for different Intel devices, as well as <span style="color:red">reusing previous builds</span> to speed up 

<span style="color:red">Login system, email, Samba, then taken on board!</span>
