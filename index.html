   description:
    - I'm now in my third and final year of Computer Science at the University of Nottingham. I spent a year at Intel <span style="color:red";>(*#link* to Intel bit)</span> last year.
    - For my final year dissertation, I am working on <em>'Mobile Style Applications for Linux'</em>, which aims to provide permissions for Linux packages, focussing on protection of privacy. The project will inform users when they are installing packages of the permissions a given application would require to function correctly, and allow the user to edit them. If a permission is denied, the Operating System will deny the application's request using standard error codes.
    - This year I'm most looking forward to the <em>Compilers</em>, <em>Software Quality Management</em>, <em>Machine Learning</em> and <em>Mobile Device Programming</em>.
 - title: Arch Linux User
   image: arch_logo.png
   description:
    - I run <a href="https://archlinux.org">Arch Linux</a> installations on my <a href="//blog.jamietanna.co.uk/desktop">desktop</a> and <a href="//blog.jamietanna.co.uk/laptop">laptop</a>. They run a minimal system, preferring a Tiling WM called <a href="https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm">BSPWM</a> over a fully blown environment such as Gnome, as it allows me to maintain a keyboard-driven setup which greatly increases my productivity.
    - I choose to use Arch Linux over other distributions because Arch gives me the choice with how I want to run my machine; by default Arch has no installer, meaning you have to install your Operating System from scratch. Although this sounds complicated, the <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Beginners%27_guide">Beginner's Guide</a> is incredibly well documented, and provides a really easy way to get set up the way you want to. This level of control is not really found in other major distributions, aside from maybe Gentoo, and definitely not found in that of Windows or Mac OSX; as I <span style="color:red";>(*#link* to Workflow bit)</span> am a believer of developing and optimising workflow, I like having a system in which I don't have more moving parts than is needed, or that <span style="color:red">___</span>.
    - I also love <a href="https://wiki.installgentoo.com/index.php/GNU/Linux_ricing">ricing</a> <a href="//blog.jamietanna.co.uk/devices">my Arch Linux installs</a>. I never feel quite happy with my setup, so will constantly try to improve it; my installs are evolutionary, not static.
 - title: Automater
   image: automation.png
   description:
    - I hold the philosophy of "if you have to repeat a task more than twice, you need to automate it". One of the best things about being a programmer is that I have the ability to do this - to automate the repetitive tasks that I'd rather not continually do. Whether this is rerunning my tests as soon as a source file has changed, or filling out a form that little bit quicker, I'll automate it.
    - By automating these small tasks, it means I get to spend more time on the important things, like <a href="#projects" style="color:red">actually building cool things</a>.
    - I primarily use one-liners in Bash, but if it gets to be more complicated I will most probably write a Bash script, or for more robust scripts, and ease of readability and maintenance, write it in Python.
    - Unfortunately, I seem to fall prey to the ever relevant XKCDs; <a href="https://xkcd.com/1319">Automation</a>, <a href="https://xkcd.com/1205/">Is It Worth the Time?</a> and <a href="https://xkcd.com/974/">The General Problem</a>.
 - title: Competitive Programmer
   image: icpc_logo.jpg
   description:
   - Since my second year of university, I have enjoyed participating in ACM-style programming competitions. These have been useful not just for the ability to expand my problem solving skills, but also for the chance to learn C++ in much more depth, exposing me to the ins and outs of the C++ Standard Library.
   - I primarily work as the programmer, as between my team I am most competent at the programming side given my experience in the past with competitive programming.
   - I've recently started using a TDD approach to automate testing of problems, which allows me to run my tests on each file save.<span style="color:red">This process allows me to very quickly determine whether my code passes ___</span>. This allows me to focus on implementing solutions instead of being <span style="color:red">bogged down</span> by working out the best method of testing.
   - <span style="color:red">TODO put script on Github?</span>
 - title: Workflow
   image: workflow.png
   description:
   - Productivity is important to me, because it allows me to focus on getting <span style="color:red">things</span> done.
   - As I mentioned in <span style="color:red";>(*#link* to Automation bit)</span>, I <span style="color:red">...</span>.
   - As part of my strive to improve productivity, I invest time in developing my workflow in order to speed up the time I work on code. <span style="color:red";>... (*#link* to Vim bit)</span>
   - My common workflow involves heavy use of Git, Vim and the general command line, due to the simplicity and composability it provides. By using a Tiling Window Manager <span style="color:red";>... (*#link* to ????? bit)</span>, I am able to ensure that my hands almost never leave the keyboard, which I find increases my productivity, as well as having uniform keybindings between applications such as Chromium, Vim and BSPWM.
 - title: Hacker
   image: hackathon.jpg
   description:
   - I regularly participate in hackathons, where I love spending the weekend learning something new and building something awesome. I don't always have a finished project to show for it, but I really enjoy the learning process itself.
   - <span style="color:red">I've recently found myself taking more of a teaching role than actually working on hacks.</a>

 - title: Gamer
   image: gaming.png
   description:
   - I enjoy playing games as a passtime, where I <span style="color:red>">___</span>. I can be found playing a variety of games on <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/professorgumby/">Steam</a>, leading my squad on <a href="http://battlelog.battlefield.com/bf4/user/gumbyesq/">Battlefield 4</a>, and until recently, running heists on <a href="https://pd2stats.com/profiles/76561197994125679">Payday 2</a>.

   description: 
    - While organising <a href="https://hacknotts.com">HackNotts</a>, I found that while <a href="https://my.mlh.io/">MyMLH</a> API was great for collecting the data from all attendees, it did not provide any ability for us to have ticket release features like releasing tickets in batches, or working out when to allocate tickets into the waitlist.
    - <span style="color:red">As such, I have organised a <a href="">Trello board</a> with feature requests I will be aiming to complete for the system. This will be hacked upon in my free time, and when I go to hacks without an idea</span>

 - title: Dotfiles

   github: jamietanna/dotfiles-arch
   gitlab:
   description: 
    - My dotfiles are all the configuration files I use with my Arch install, such as Vim and my Window Manager, BSPWM. These configs are shared on Github so I can easily clone them wherever I am, and also so others can see how I like things configured.
    - I try to keep my dotfiles following good practices, both with Git, and with its code. As such, my commit messages explain the reasonings for the changes, in such a way that I'll be able to go back and work out why I added it. 
    - I recently added the ability to bootstrap my system by simply cloning the repo and running `./bootstrap.sh`, which installs my dotfiles in the correct places and installs all associated dependencies needed.

   gitlab:
   description: 
    - When working at Intel<span style="color:red";>(*#link* to Intel bit)</span>, I was administering a server which required multiple users to have access to different areas of the web server via authentication means. Instead of working on some sort of server-side application to manage this, I decided to go with HTTP Basic Authentication. However, to reduce the amount of repetition needed, I threw together a script called Nginx htgroups, or nggroup for short, which provided a CLI-driven method of organising multiple users and their access rights.

   github:
   gitlab:
   description: 
    - While working at Intel, I was part of an Android tablet project for a large UK retailer. As part of this, we worked on building versions of the Android Operating System with custom patches. The turnaround for the whole build process was around 40 minutes, which at times was <span style="color:red">unforgiving</span>. Therefore, I was tasked with setting up a server internally that would allow us to build Android much more quickly.
    - I used Docker to set up isolated environments which would contain all necessary dependencies for the version of Android needed for different Intel devices, as well as <span style="color:red">reusing previous builds</span> to speed up 
    - <span style="color:red">Login system, email, Samba</span>

   description: 
   - In my second year group project, we created an application called Football Facsimile, which aimed to recreate the game of football as a fully independent computer simulation. Each player in the <span style="color:red">five-aside</span> game was modelled as an <span style="color:red">agent in the simulation</span>, and <span style="color:red">???</span>.
   - The project was created with Java using the <a href="http://lwjgl.org">Lightweight Java Game Library</a>.

   image: projects-disarm.png
   github:
   gitlab:
   description: 
   - disARM is the final coursework from my first year Introduction to Programming course at Nottingham. We were tasked with creating a disassembler, which would take in a compiled ARM Executable and Linked Format file, and output the instructions that the file contains. I asked my lecturer whether it were possible to determine what label the <code>ADR</code> and <code>ADRL</code> instructions were pointing to, but he mentioned it was not. However, I decided to look into the ELF format, and discovered the Symbol table. Following this, I was able to work out the correct addresses, and insert them instead of some offset.
   - This project was one of my first large achievements, and as such I am really happy with the resulting program. The code, however, is not at all something I'm happy with, but I realise a few years really does make a difference.
