 - title: Student
   description:
    - I'm now in my third and final year of Computer Science at the University of Nottingham. I spent a year at Intel <span style="color:red";>(*#link* to Intel bit)</span> last year.
    - For my final year dissertation, I am working on <em>'Mobile Style Applications for Linux'</em>, which aims to provide permissions for Linux packages, focussing on protection of privacy. The project will inform users when they are installing packages of the permissions a given application would require to function correctly, and allow the user to edit them. If a permission is denied, the Operating System will deny the application's request using standard error codes.
    - This year I'm most looking forward to the <em>Compilers</em>, <em>Software Quality Management</em>, <em>Machine Learning</em> and <em>Mobile Device Programming</em>.
 - title: Arch Linux User
   description:
    - I run <a href="https://archlinux.org">Arch Linux</a> installations on my <a href="//blog.jamietanna.co.uk/desktop">desktop</a> and <a href="//blog.jamietanna.co.uk/laptop">laptop</a>. They run a minimal system, preferring a Tiling WM called <a href="https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm">BSPWM</a> over a fully blown environment such as Gnome, as it allows me to maintain a keyboard-driven setup which greatly increases my productivity.
    - I choose to use Arch Linux over other distributions because Arch gives me the choice with how I want to run my machine; by default Arch has no installer, meaning you have to install your Operating System from scratch. Although this sounds complicated, the <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Beginners%27_guide">Beginner's Guide</a> is incredibly well documented, and provides a really easy way to get set up the way you want to. This level of control is not really found in other major distributions, aside from maybe Gentoo, and definitely not found in that of Windows or Mac OSX; as I <span style="color:red";>(*#link* to Workflow bit)</span> am a believer of developing and optimising workflow, I like having a system in which I don't have more moving parts than is needed, or that <span style="color:red">___</span>.
 - title: Ricer
   description:
    - I love <a href="https://wiki.installgentoo.com/index.php/GNU/Linux_ricing">ricing</a> <a href="//blog.jamietanna.co.uk/devices">my Arch Linux installs</a>. I never feel quite happy with my setup, so will constantly try to improve it; my installs are evolutionary, not static.
 - title: Automater
   description:
    - I hold the philosophy of "if you have to repeat a task more than twice, you need to automate it". One of the best things about being a programmer is that I have the ability to do this - to automate the repetitive tasks that I'd rather not continually do. Whether this is rerunning my tests as soon as a source file has changed, or filling out a form that little bit quicker, I'll automate it.
    - By automating these small tasks, it means I get to spend more time on the important things, like <a href="#projects" style="color:red">actually building cool things</a>.
    - I primarily use one-liners in Bash, but if it gets to be more complicated I will most probably write a Bash script, or for more robust scripts, and ease of readability and maintenance, write it in Python.
    - Unfortunately, I seem to fall prey to the ever relevant XKCDs; <a href="https://xkcd.com/1319">Automation</a>, <a href="https://xkcd.com/1205/">Is It Worth the Time?</a> and <a href="https://xkcd.com/974/">The General Problem</a>.
 - title: Competitive Programmer
   description:
   - Since my second year of university, I have enjoyed participating in ACM-style programming competitions. These have been useful not just for the ability to expand my problem solving skills, but also for the chance to learn C++ in much more depth, exposing me to the ins and outs of the C++ Standard Library.
   - I primarily work as the programmer, as between my team I am most competent at the programming side given my experience in the past with competitive programming.
   - I've recently started using a TDD approach to automate testing of problems, which allows me to run my tests on each file save.<span style="color:red">This process allows me to very quickly determine whether my code passes ___</span>. This allows me to focus on implementing solutions instead of being <span style="color:red">bogged down</span> by working out the best method of testing.

 - title: Dotfiles

   github: jamietanna/dotfiles-arch
   gitlab:
   description: 
    - My dotfiles are all the configuration files I use with my Arch install, such as Vim and my Window Manager, BSPWM. These configs are shared on Github so I can easily clone them wherever I am, and also so others can see how I like things configured.
    - I try to keep my dotfiles following good practices, both with Git, and with its code. As such, my commit messages explain the reasonings for the changes, in such a way that I'll be able to go back and work out why I added it. 
    - I recently added the ability to bootstrap my system by simply cloning the repo and running `./bootstrap.sh`, which installs my dotfiles in the correct places and installs all associated dependencies needed.
