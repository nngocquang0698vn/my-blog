<p>I'm a Software Quality Engineer with a passion for backend engineering, especially with regard to APIs and automation. I've been building up my experience working in a DevOps environment as a Software Development Engineer and am now diving into the details of how we prove out the quality in our software. I use my site as a method of blogging about my learnings, as well as sharing information about projects I have previously, or are currently, working on in my spare time.</p>
<p>I'm a GNU/Linux user, a big advocate for the Free Software Movement, and I try to self host my own services where possible, instead of relying on other providers.</p>
