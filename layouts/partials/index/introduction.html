    <p>Hi, I'm <a class="p-name u-uid u-url" rel="me" href="https://www.jvt.me">Jamie Tanna</a> (<span class="p-x-pronoun-nominative">he</span>/<span class="p-x-pronoun-oblique">him</span>/<span class="p-x-pronoun-possessive">his</span>) <img class="u-photo" src="https://www.jvt.me/img/profile.png" alt="Jamie Tanna's profile image" />, and I'm currently a <span class="p-job-title">Software Development Engineer 2</span> with a passion for backend engineering, especially with regard to APIs and automation.</p>
    <p>I've been building up my experience working in a DevOps environment while working at <a class="p-org h-card" href="https://capitalone.co.uk">Capital One UK</a> as a Software Development Engineer and a Software Quality Engineer working on Consumer Identity, but I am now working on Third Party API engineering.</p>
    <p>I currently live in <span class="p-locality">Nottingham</span> with my partner <span class="h-card"><a class="p-name u-url" href="https://annadodson.co.uk">Anna Dodson</a></span> and our beautiful terror of a cat <a href="/tags/morph/">Morph</a>.</p>
    <p>I use my site as a method of blogging about my learnings, as well as sharing information about projects I have previously, or are currently, working on in my spare time.</p>
    <p>I'm a GNU/Linux user, a big advocate for the Free Software Movement, and the <a href="https://indieweb.org/why">IndieWeb movement</a> and I try to self host my own services where possible, instead of relying on other providers.</p>
