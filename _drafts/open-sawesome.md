One thing you'll notice is that I made a number of commits to the HacksocNotts repos: _11_ in total, in fact. Almost half of the things I helped out with were _??_.

- Not great
- Lots of smalelr changes
- Not nearly as mcuh of an impact as Hacktoberfest
- Felt making commits just because I had to
- Lots of "easy" ones
- Hacksoc were ones that were discussed/useful
	- Things that can help with them (previously discussed)
	- Things that have helped me understand more about Jekyll
		- But the site should be Hacksoc people


**TODO** source of script?
