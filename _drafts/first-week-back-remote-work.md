After almost three months off work, due to my [Ruptured Appendix][ruptured-appendix], I returned to **work**.

At the beginning of March, I was cleared to remotely return to work by my consultant, on the condition I would only **max 4 hours**. Last Thursday I met with my manager Gareth who was in London for a couple of days of workshops. He brought my laptop with him and **??**.
Not only was it my first excursion **for long period of time**, but also contact with someone other than a handful of family.
We had a good catchup over the course of an hour and a coffee, and Gareth filled me in on what had been happening over the last few months. **Reorg**

We also chatted about what I'd be starting to work on - firstly, due to the End of Life of Chef 12 support, we'd be [upgrading to Chef 13][chef-13-upgrade]. I'd already started this process with the Chef infrastructure for [Spectat Designs][spectatdesigns], my web development company. Secondly, I'd be looking at putting together a more involved runbook for our production services, to help aid the on-call support aspect of the team's duties.

```
- great catchup of last three months
- look forward to next few months
- discussion about my tasks while looking at returning to work
```

On Thursday I worked through my compliance business training, which left my Friday hours free to plan the work I'd be undertaking. **what work** On both days, I didn't even make use of my first four hours, and when I closed my laptop for the day, I also turned off my work phone which was a big step for me given the last few weeks I'd been keeping an eye on Slack and emails, but at this point I wanted to show I was taking my **time constraints seriously**.

The last few days I've had some incredibly productive hours, being **??**.
I've found that being time limited in a much more restrictive way has meant that I'm much more careful as to how much I try to fit within my four hours - if I've got about a half hour of my time left, I won't try and pick up some new work, whereas during my regular hours, I'd just work a little extra that night (which would sometimes turn into hours). This approach has been really quite satisfying, as I've left each day thinking "wow, I'm glad I've got that much done".
However, I think it's also as I've got a clear separation between each of the tasks I've planned out, meaning I can more easily stop, whereas the work I'd been doing previously wasn't as easy to drop part way through one of the tasks.

I've also been really enjoying the split between being able to get some productive time at work, and working on my own projects. I've recently been taking the **free time I've had before I'm ready to work** to invest some time into [Spectat Designs][spectatdesigns], whose infrastructure I'm Chef-ifying as well as also bringing more automation **??**. This has always been a project on my backlog, but I'd just not got around to it, but this free time has given me the **drive/ability** to get to it.

Made me think that I need to be more efficient with my time (as said in Year in Review)

```
- split time
  - better use of time
  - getting lots done
    - work
    - spectat
  - need to be more efficient in the future
```

```
- missing the team
  - moreso, can't talk about things
  - and lots going on
```


However, yesterday (**Wednesday**) I ended up doing closer to a full day of work.
It turns out that getting into writing a Ruby Gem for Chef Rake tasks got a little **??**, as reducing repetition is a **huge thing to me**.
I've been quite good so far, but unfortunately **??**
As it's incredibly similar work to that which I'd be doing outside of work, **it was okay**.

```
- wednesday did over 4
  - oops!
  - very similar work as would be doing outside of work
```

```
- photos of work, personal setup
