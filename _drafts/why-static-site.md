**TODO: What's the target audience? Spectat? Techies?**

When deciding how you want to build your personal or professional website, you may flock directly to something like Wordpress, due to the large market share, and because "everyone else is using it". However, it's not always the right answer. You need to ask yourself the following questions:

- How do I want to edit content on my site?
- How do I want to be able to release changes?
- How much time do I want to spend on administration?
- How/do I want to automagically share content?

I'll compare these options for a Content Management System (CMS) Driven Site versus a Static Site.

**TODO: provide definitions?**


## Content Management System Driven Site

### Editing

### Releasing Changes

### Administration

### Content Sharing / Promotion


## Static Site

### Pro

- Deployment fun - {% post_url 2017-07-18-gitlab-review-apps-capistrano %}
- Offline editing
- Use any tool for the job
- Orders of magnitude fewer security issues

### Con

- Time to deploy / time to live
- Less plugins to perform things like auto post to i.e. Twitter

## Database-Driven Site (i.e. CMS)

### Pro

-

### Con

- Potential sysadmin work
- Bloat

## **Middling**
